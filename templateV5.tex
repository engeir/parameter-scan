\abstract{%
  Large eruptions to super-volcano sized eruptions are simulated in the \ac*{cesm2}
  climate model with the \ac*{waccm} atmosphere. Ensembles containing four members are
  simulated and the \ac*{aod} and \ac*{rf} from the eruptions are compared to determine
  how far the linear relationship between the two parameters hold. Simulating a
  Pinatubo-like eruption yields results consistent with several previous studies showing
  a slope of \(\sim \SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) per unit \acs*{aod}. Larger eruptions,
  however, show a time-after-eruption dependence, where the \acs*{rf} is relatively
  stronger than \acs*{aod} the first year after an eruption (higher cooling efficiency),
  while in the later phase their ratio is roughly constant for a given eruption
  strength, but where smaller eruptions have a larger ratio and as such are more
  efficient.

% NOTE: what to include in the paper, key questions.
% The paper should provide insight about what might happen if a large volcano erupted
% (order of magnitude or more than Mt.\ Pinatubo). How does the atmosphere react, for
% example in the aerosol dynamics? (QBO, SO2/AOD/RF relationship.) It should also be
% about how volcanic simulations compare in magnitude and if there is time for more
% simulations, how model complexity (dynamic ocean against slab ocean) affect things.
% - How far does the linear relation between AOD and RF go? What phases does the
%   aerosols go though? (Perhaps the most promising avenue.)
% - How much does it matter how high in the atmosphere the initial SO2 is injected?
%   (Already is some literature on this, suggesting it is not much. Also some on
%   latitude dependence, which has a bigger influence.)
% - How does the climate response change based on the state of the climate: what if we
%   run a CO2 doubling or quadrupling simulation until close to equilibrium, and let the
%   volcanoes erupt then? (Lack the doubling scenario, and setting it up has resulted in
%   strange output that must be resolved. Could take a while.)

\paragraph*{Historical background: Volcanoes in climate science}

During much of the past few thousand years, the Holocene, the natural climate
variability on Earth has been mostly forced by volcanic eruptions \citep{sigl2022}.
Despite the strong climate variability impact of volcanic eruptions, in particular up to
the current anthropogenic forcing of the climate, few climate model experiments have
included volcanic forcing when simulating climate evolution during the Holocene
\citep{sigl2022}, implying an exaggerated positive forcing \citep{gregory2016}. Thus,
even though the understanding of how volcanic eruptions force the climate has been given
much attention, questions for example related to aerosol particle processes such as how
they grow, which impacts their scattering efficiency and possibly the \ac{aod} to
\ac{rf} relationship is still unanswered
\citep[e.g.][]{robock2000,zanchettin2019,marshall2020,marshall2022}.
% FIX: what specifically is unanswered? Do I get into this in the later sections?

% NOTE: Section on similarities between CO2 and volcanic forcing. (feedback params
% references). Richardson is doing something that looks very similar to Gunther 2022.
% Mention that as well? (Similarity bw 0.5CO2 and volcanoes.)

\paragraph*{Historical background: Can volcanoes aid \ce{CO2} in constraining \ac{ecs}?}

One avenue that has been given much attention is how forcing from volcanoes or
volcano-like forcings compares to the forcing that is due to increased \ce{CO2} levels.
\citet{boer2007,marvel2016,merlis2014,ollila2016,richardson2019,salvi2022,wigley2005}
all investigate the link, or if any exists, between volcanic forcing and the climate
sensitivity to a doubling of \ce{CO2}, a much used metric for describing the severity of
global warming. This comparison is motivated by the large uncertainty in estimates of
the sensitivity of the real climate system, and inferring climate sensitivity from for
example volcanoes have been used as an attempt to constrain the sensitivity
\citep{boer2007}. Such a constraint rely on the assumption that volcanic forcing and
\ce{CO2} forcing produce correlated feedbacks \citep{pauling2023}. Among these, some
have been running simulations of the 1991 Mt.\ Pinatubo eruption
\citep{merlis2014,ollila2016} or historical volcano or volcano-like forcings
\citep{boer2007,marvel2016,wigley2005}, while some investigate aerosol forcing in
general \citep{richardson2019,salvi2022}. Many earlier studies assume that \ac{ecs} can
be inferred from volcanoes \citep{wigley2005} or suggest that it might be possible
\citep{bender2010}, as long as \ac{ecs} is constrained by \ac{erf} and not \ac{irf},
which differ in that \ac{erf} account for rapid atmospheric adjustments while \ac{irf}
do not \citep{richardson2019}. Other studies suggest either that constraining \ac{ecs}
by \ac{erf} is not possible and that the sensitivity to volcanic forcing and \ce{CO2}
doubling are different, or that constraining the \ac{ecs} by \ac{erf} will be inaccurate
since the precision at which climate simulations are run is not high enough
\citep{douglass2006,boer2007,salvi2022}. Even though \ac{erf} is a more suited indicator
of the temperature response to a forcing than \ac{irf}
\citep{marvel2016,richardson2019}, more recent studies conclude that \ac{ecs} cannot be
constrained from volcanoes \citep{pauling2023}.

\paragraph*{Theoretical background: Aerosol evolution and atm.\ dynamics}

\ce{H2O}, \ce{N2} and \ce{CO2} are the most abundant gases emitted by volcanoes
\citep{robock2000}, but still, sulphur species like \ce{SO2} are the most influential
due to the already relatively high concentrations of the former gases in the atmosphere.
From \ce{SO2} \ce{H2SO4} is formed after reactions with \ce{OH} and \ce{H2O}
\citep{robock2000}. Sulphate acid, \ce{H2SO4}, produces the largest effect by
backscattering sunlight and thus increasing the planetary albedo and reducing the
\ac{rf} from the Sun, and since its formation from \ce{SO2} is happening over weeks
\citep{robock2000}, the peak \ac{rf} from the eruption has a slight delay from the onset
of the eruption. The duration of time that the \ce{H2SO4} aerosols stay in the
atmosphere depends on several factors, including the phase of the \ac{qbo}
\citep{pitari2016b}, the season of the year (determining to which hemisphere aerosols
are transported) \citep{toohey2011,toohey2019}, latitude \citep{marshall2019,
  toohey2019}, volcanic plume height \citep{marshall2019} and the aerosol size
\citep{marshall2019}. But in the case of tropical eruptions, aerosols are typically
transported poleward in the stratosphere and back to mid-latitude troposphere within one
to two years \citep{robock2000}.
% TODO: mention that aerosols are washed out by droplets? This does not occur in the
% stratosphere

% Section on RF to AOD ratio

\paragraph*{Similar contributions: Comparing \acs*{rf} and \acs*{aod}}

Previous studies on both Mt.\ Pinatubo alone \citep{mills2017,hansen2005} and volcanoes
in the instrumental era \citep{gregory2016} have been used to estimate the relationship
between the \ac{rf} energy imbalance caused by volcanic eruptions and \ac{aod}.
\citet{myhre2013} use a formula for \ac{rf} that scales \ac{aod} by
\(\SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) while values down to
\(\SI{-19.0(5)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{gregory2016} and
\(\SI{-18.3(10)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{mills2017} have been
reported more recently. Simulations done with synthetic volcanoes have also been used,
and in \citet{marshall2020} they obtain a scaling factor of
\(\SI{-20.5(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) from simulating \(82\) volcanic
eruptions with varying injection height and latitude, ranging from \(10\) to
\(\SI{100}{\tera\gram}\) of \iso{}.

A similar simulation setup, albeit with notable differences, was done by
\citet{niemeier2015}, where \(14\) different levels of injected sulphur ranging between
\(\SI{1}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) and
\(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) was simulated. These were
geoengineering simulations where sulphur would be continually injected, and the
simulations run until the sulphur level was in a steady state. From this, they found
that the \ac{rf} to injected rate ratio would follow an exponential and converge to a
value of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\). While the results from the super-volcano
simulation by \citet{jones2005} indicate a weaker gradient than the \(-18.3\) to \(-25\)
found in more recent literature, the peak \ac{rf} obtained in the super-volcano
simulation was \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\), suggesting the \citet{niemeier2015}
results might be transferable to a volcanic eruption simulation scenario.

\paragraph*{Similar contributions: Time-after-eruption dependence}

The aerosol evolution and lifetime in the stratosphere influence the \ac{aod} and the
\ac{rf}, but not always in the same way. \citet{marshall2020} present results showing
higher efficiencies in years 2 and 3 after an eruption, compared to year 1, suggesting
that this is due to the aerosols being concentrated more spatially in the first year and
more spread out in later years. This has the effect of increasing the albedo per global
mean \ac{aod} which in turn increases the \ac{rf} per \ac{aod} \citep{marshall2020}.
(Also, \ac{aod} to \ac{rf} depend on insulation, cloudiness and surface albedo among
others, which vary across eruptions \citep{marshall2021,andersson2015}.)

% \citet{marshall2022} mention (in the graphic in their figure 1) that the \emph{role of
%   initial conditions} is a key outstanding question, especially if the \ce{CO2}
% doubling simulations work out, this could be a contribution to that.
% Also, when aerosols grow, they scatter radiation less efficiently and also fall down
% faster, so the temperature response should be comparatively weaker for increasing
% eruption magnitude (or the volcanic aerosols are less efficient). \emph{Clustering} and
% long term effects are mentioned in its own section (Multi-decadal impacts) along with
% the \emph{dependence of the current climate state}.

% \citet{marshall2019} does many similar things to what I have done, but do not focus on
% seasonal variability. This is however mentioned as one other direction to dig into, but
% is somewhat covered by \citet{marshall2020}. Assumes that there is an $e$-folding time,
% but notes that it does change, so they calculate an average time over a small range
% (from a month after the peak until reaching ten percent of the peak). They further note
% that the $e$-folding time is dependent on latitude mostly, but also on injected
% \ce{SO2}. Their eruptions all occur in July, but with the equivalent winter (January)
% eruptions covered by \citet{marshall2020}.

% In \citet{marshall2020}, they take the reconstructed \ac{aod} from
% \citet{toohey2017}, convert it to radiative forcing based on their conversions, and plot
% the corresponding temperature time series from each radiative forcing using a simple
% climate model. \emph{So, can we use this with the \ac{fpp} framework? (Noisy data?
%   Check this.)}
% TODO: check the data if it can be used for FPP.

% \paragraph*{Motivation}
%
% From \citet{pauling2023}: what aspect of the climate system control the response to
% volcanic eruptions?
%
% From \citet{marshall2022}: However, uncertainties remain regarding the role of internal
% variability and the dependence on the current climate state. Also \citet{aubry2022} give
% a review on this very topic. They emphasise the urgency to accelerate research on
% climate-volcano impacts (a niche topic to date).

\paragraph*{This paper's contributions}

Considering the linear relationship often found between \ac{aod} and \ac{rf}
\citep{gregory2016, marshall2020, mills2017, myhre2013} along with studies indicating a
non-linear relationship \citep{niemeier2015}, as well as a time-after-eruption
dependence \citep{marshall2020}, we see that for large to super-volcano sized volcanic
eruptions there is both a clear non-linear \ac{aod} to \ac{rf} dependence explored in
section \ldots, but also a time-after-eruption dependence on both \ac{aod} and \ac{rf},
which we look at in section \ldots. In section \ldots, conclusions about the underlying
atmospheric dynamics are made.

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

We apply the \ac{cesm2} \citep{danabasoglu2020}, along with the \ac{waccm}
\citep{gettleman2019} and the fully dynamical ocean component \ac{pop} \citep{smith2010,
  danabasoglu2020}. The complete list of model components is found in
\cref{tab:cesm-components}. The model atmosphere was run at nominal \(\SI{2}{\degree}\)
resolution, with \(70\) vertical levels, in the \ac{ma} configuration.

The \ac{ma} version of \ac{waccm} uses the \ac{mam3} \citep{gettleman2019}. This is
implemented as a simplified and computationally efficient default setting in the
\ac{cam5} \citep{liu2016}, and is described in \citet{liu2012}. The \ac{mam3} was
developed from MAM7 (seven modes) by merging the primary carbon mode with the
accumulation mode, and assuming instantaneous internal mixing of primary carbonaceous
aerosols with secondary aerosols \citep{liu2016}. Specifically, the three modes are
Aitken, accumulation and coarse (MAM7 includes Aitken, accumulation, primary carbon,
fine dust and fine sea salt, coarse dust and coarse sea salt modes) \citep{liu2016}.
Instantaneous ageing of primary carbonaceous particles is assumed by emitting them in
the accumulation mode. The \ac{mam3} include \(15\) transported aerosol tracers
\citep{liu2016}. \citet{marshall2019, marshall2020, marshall2021} used a code with seven
log-normal modes to simulate aerosol mass and number concentrations, but their model is
an \ac{agcm}, as opposed to the \ac{cesm2} which is an \ac{esm} or \ac{aogcm}.

Dust absorbs water efficiently and is thus expected to be removed by wet deposition
similarly to sea salt, which makes the course mode (mode 3, of which sea salt and soil
dust are both part of) quickly retain its background state below the tropopause
\citep{liu2012}. Likewise, fine dust and fine sea salt are both merged into the
accumulation mode (mode 2).

% NOTE: maybe Maria have an idea?
% \citet{liu2012} says the accumulation mode is roughly $90\%$ of the sulfate burden,
% which I don't really get from my figures. Hmm, need to look more into this.

\subsection{Simulation set up}

Simulations were created using a modified version of the file
\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl},
% \href{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl}{\texttt{createVolcEruptV3.ncl}}
via a Python project developed on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking}. The project is also available from the
Python package manager PyPI\@. The program creates volcanoes with a given \ce{SO2}
amount that is injected over six
hours\footnote{\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl}}
at a given altitude, latitude and longitude. All volcanic \ce{SO2} files are created by
setting the eruption details in a~.json file that is read to the
\texttt{volcano-cooking} CLI at a fixed version, making the experiment setup
reproducible.

We are using the \texttt{BWma1850} component
setup\footnote{\url{https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/config/2.1.0/compsets.html}}
to run the \ac{cesm2}, and an accompanying \ac{fsst}
% WARN: how should the fSST compset be referred to
simulation to obtain estimates of the \ac{rf}. The \ac{fsst} simulation used is not from
a standardised component setup as of \ac{cesm2} (v2.1.3), but is instead specified in
full.\footnote{\fssturl}
% as (\texttt{BWma1850} full name
% also shown for comparison)
% \begin{small}
%   \begin{verbatim}
% BWma1850 ->
%   1850_CAM60%WCCM_CLM50%BGC-CROP_CICE_
%   POP2%ECO%NDEP_MOSART_CISM2%NOEVOLVE_WW3

%   DOCN%DOM_MOSART_CISM2%NOEVOLVE_SWAV_TEST
%   \end{verbatim}
% \end{small}
%
They differ in \texttt{CICE -> CICE\%PRES}, which is prescribed sea-ice,
\texttt{POP2\%ECO\%DEP -> DOCN\%DOM} which is from a dynamical ocean to a prescribed
data ocean and the wave component \texttt{WW3 -> SWAV} which is now a stub wave
component instead of the full \ac{ww3}.

\subsection{Output variables}

\Ac{rf} is calculated as the combined (\ac{sw} and \ac{lw}) all-sky \ac{toa} energy
imbalance, where the \ac{cesm2} provides the output variables \ac{fsnt} and \ac{flnt}.
Thus, \(\mathrm{RF_*}= \mathrm{FSNT} - \mathrm{FLNT}\), and taking the difference
between volcanic simulations and a control simulation gives the final estimate of
\ac{rf} (\(\mathrm{RF}=\mathrm{RF_{VOLC}}-\mathrm{RF_{CONTROL}}\)) \citep{marshall2020}.
This outline specifically describe how to calculate \ac{erf} as opposed to \ac{irf},
which instead is the difference between the \ac{erf} and the sum of all rapid
atmospheric adjustments \citep{marshall2020,smith2018}. The \ac{aod} is obtained from
the output variable \ac{aodm}, while global temperature is saved by \ac{cesm2} to the
variable \ac{trefht}. These four output variables are all that are used throughout this
paper. The important input data used in the model simulations are \iso{} in units of
teragrams, used to simulate volcanic eruptions.

\subsection{Simulations}

The simulations are summarized in \cref{tab:simulation-overview} and cover three
\ce{SO2} injection magnitudes and four seasons; 15 February, 15 May, 15 August and 15
November. The magnitudes vary across three orders of magnitude: \(\SI{26}{\tera\gram}\),
\(\SI{400}{\tera\gram}\) and \(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram}\). The smallest eruption is of the
same order of magnitude as Mt.\ Pinatubo
\citep[\(\sim10\)--\(\SI{20}{\tera\gram}\);~e.g.][]{timmreck2018} and Mt.\ Tambora
\citep[\(\sim\SI{56.2}{\tera\gram}\);~e.g.][]{zanchettin2016}, the intermediate is
similar to the 1257 Samalas eruption
\citep[\(\sim{119}\)--\(\SI{250}{\tera\gram}\);~e.g.][]{toohey2017,ottobliesner2016},
and the largest is similar to the \ac{ytt} eruption
\citep[\(100\)--\(\SI{10000}{\tera\gram}\);][and~references~therein]{jones2005}. They
are all located at the equator, at \(\SI{0}{\degree N}\), \(\SI{1}{\degree E}\) and
\ce{SO2} is injected between \(\SI{18}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{20}{\kilo\meter}\). An
advantage with having eruptions this big, in the large to super-volcano size, is
improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio without having to run a large and
computationally expensive ensemble. However, this still leave the question of whether
this will give realistic values for the forcing open \citep{gregory2016}.

\section{Results}

% NOTE: the results should be laid out in a logical way, with the most
% interesting/important stuff first, then tangents that dig deeper at specific things
% later.
% 1. RF to AOD time-after-eruption dependence should be top priority (8 figs atm.)
% 2. Then probably temperature scaling since we discuss the shape of both AOD and RF
%    time series before that (MOTIVATION: can we expect a specific temperature time
%    series shape based on the shape of either of or both of the RF and AOD time
%    series?)
% 3. If there is something interesting to say about the rest of the figures (all the
%    comparing of parameters), then this should come here.

\subsection{Part 1}

In this section, we investigate the effect of the forcing strength on the \ac{aod} and
\ac{rf}, which are both parameters used to provide insight about how volcanic eruptions
impact climate. A similar comparison was carried out in \citet[][their Fig.\
  4]{gregory2016} and \citet[][their Fig.\ 1]{marshall2020}, with \ac{rf} to \ac{aod}
plots. \Cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full} show annual mean values from the four simulation cases
in \cref{tab:simulation-overview}; the smallest eruption case as blue downward pointing
triangles, the intermediate eruption case as orange thick diamonds, the large tropical
eruption case as green upward pointing triangles, the large northern hemisphere eruption
case as brown upward pointing three-branched twigs, and the data from \citet[][Fig.\ 4,
  black crosses from HadCM3 sstPiHistVol]{gregory2016} as grey crosses. Additionally, the
estimated peak values from the Mt.\ Pinatubo eruption and Mt.\ Tambora eruption are
plotted as a purple star and a yellow plus, while the peak from the \citet{jones2005}
super-volcano simulation is shown as a pink square. Finally, red circles represent the
peak values obtained from the three tropical eruptions (\ac{c2wm}, \ac{c2wmp} and
\ac{c2ws}). The gradient lines are the same as shown by \citet{gregory2016}.

The annual mean data from the smallest Pinatubo-like eruption shown in
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_inset} as blue downward facing triangles, has \ac{rf} values as a
function of \ac{aod} that follow almost the same constant gradient as the
\citet{gregory2016} data. However, we do find that the stronger eruptions lead to
dissimilar responses in \ac{aod} and \ac{rf}, where the slope of the intermediate seem
to follow close to a \(-10\) gradient and the large is closer to a \(-4\) gradient. The
peak values (red circles) suggest a non-linear functional shape dependence, while within
each eruption strength the annual mean values fall relatively close to a straight line.
% FIX: This last part might be removed and better explained via the ratio plots.

\subsection{Part 2}

To further look into the responses in \ac{aod} and \ac{rf} due to the differently sized
volcanic eruptions, we plot in
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled} seasonal means
where the start of the time series is taken as that of the eruption day.
% <Removed fig>
% show the four \ac{cesm2} simulations that simulates a single volcanic eruption; three
% simulations cover three eruption magnitudes while the last simulations is equivalent to
% the largest of the other three, but where the eruption is located at high latitude
% rather than at the equator. The plot show the same picture as
% \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full}, but the points are now seasonal means rather than yearly
% means, and the colour gives the time-after-eruption. Each season has its own colour
% (shown in the colour palette in the top right of the plot), except for the last year
% (from \(3\) to \(4\), one colour) and the second half of the third year (from \(2.5\) to
% \(3\), one colour). The later times are given fewer colour segments to better resolve
% the time-after-eruption where the \ac{aod} and \ac{rf} values changes the most. <Removed
% fig> show the same as <removed fig>, except the seasonal means are computed from
% normalized \ac{aod} and \ac{rf} time series.
\Cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled} show the
\ac{rf} to \ac{aod} ratios from \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full,fig:aod_vs_toa_inset}, but
where the data is averaged to seasonal means rather than yearly means. In
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio}, straight lines are linear regression fits to the
seasonal means across all four ensembles, summarised in \cref{tab:slope-gradients}.
Shaded regions are the standard deviation around the seasonal means. A similar shading
is plotted in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled}, but where the regression fits
have been omitted to avoid further cluttering the plot. The years where the
signal-to-noise ratio is the lowest are years \(1\) and \(2\), as well as year \(0\)
(the noise is mostly due to the \ac{rf} time series, shown in
\cref{fig:toa_arrays_normalized}). Hence, the ratio of \ac{rf} to \ac{aod} is calculated
for the second season of the first year until the end of the third year.

Even though the ratio changes between the eruption magnitudes, we find that the gradient
at which the ratio is changing is similar across large eruption magnitudes. A slope of
approximately \(5.8\) is a good fit for both the intermediate (orange thick diamonds)
and the large eruption (green upward triangles), and even though the spread in the small
eruption (blue downward triangles) is large in the \(y\)-direction, they tend to follow
a similarly inclined, albeit steeper, slope. In the later phase, from the second season
of the second year, the ratios stay close to constant for the reminder of the decaying
phase.

\citet[][their Fig.\ 1c,d]{marshall2020} present results showing a time dependence in
the conversion between \ac{aod} and \ac{rf}, but where \ac{rf} is larger (more
efficient) later in the eruption evolution when compared to \ac{aod}, not smaller. This
is understood by \citet{marshall2020} to happen since the aerosols are initially
spatially confined to the hemisphere where the eruption was situated, before they during
the second and third years spread globally, leading to a larger global mean albedo per
\ac{aod} and in turn larger \ac{rf} per \ac{aod}. From their results and the results
shown here in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled},
there seems to be several and competing effects that decide on the values of \ac{aod}
and \ac{rf}.

The change in ratio, where the smallest is found in the large eruption and the largest
ratio is from the small eruption, is consistent with the change in peak values seen in
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full}, where the red circles indicate that the peak values are
saturating in \ac{rf}. The \ac{rf} peak magnitudes increases more slowly than the
\ac{aod} peak magnitudes which increases close to linearly with injected \ce{SO2} (see
also \cref{fig:so2_vs_aod}). This may be the result of larger aerosols having time to
develop as the amount of injected \ce{SO2} increases \citep{niemeier2015,marshall2019}.
This in turn make the forcing from smaller eruptions relatively more efficient than from
large eruptions since larger aerosols scatter radiation less efficiently, causing a less
negative ratio between \ac{rf} and \ac{aod}.

% \end{figure}

One feature seen in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio} is that the early phase seems
to have a \ac{rf} to \ac{aod} ratio that is changing (from about \(0\) to \(1.2\) years
after the eruption), while the later phase has an almost constant ratio (from \(1.2\) to
\(3\) years after the eruption). When plotting the \ac{rf} time series, we find that
their shapes are consistent over different eruption strengths
(\cref{fig:toa_arrays_normalized}), but the \ac{aod} time series show a slight change in
shape from smaller to larger eruptions (\cref{fig:aod_arrays_normalized}). Specifically,
the \ac{aod} time series from the smallest eruptions have a fast rise and a flat peak
before it decays back to its equilibrium state, while from the two larger eruptions we
find a slower rise time, but a sharper peak, making the decay to equilibrium happening
at a similar time after the eruption and at a similar rate.
% TODO: Why? Marshall et al. (2019) and references therein may be the best source for a
% suggested explanation.

An interesting aspect concerning the similar decaying phase seen in both the \ac{aod}
time series and the \ac{rf} time series is the influence of these decaying phases on the
temperature time series, perhaps inducing a trend. That is, do the temperature time
series have different shape in the rising phase, but similar shape in the decaying
phase? Allowing the simulations to run for at least twenty years to enable the tail to
be well resolved is therefore another avenue that could be explored further.
% WARN: The paragraph above is left hanging... Although it is connected to the next
% section.

\subsection{Part 3}

Whether the different shapes of the temperature time series can be inferred from the
shape of either of the forcing time series or not (\ac{rf} or \ac{aod}) is a natural
next step to take. Three different forcing magnitudes have been used, as outlined in
\cref{tab:simulation-overview}. The figures below show two alternative ways of
normalizing the temperature response to these volcanic forcing events. First, the three
temperature responses are normalized by setting the smoothed peak\footnote{the peak of a
  third-order Savitzky-Golay filter with a one year long window length} value equal to
one, shown in \cref{fig:compare-waveform-max}. The second method of normalizing, shown
in \cref{fig:compare-waveform-integrate}, is to divide by the integral of the time
series, such that the scaled time series integrate to one.

When normalizing by setting their amplitude to one, the initial rise across all three
time series is comparable. The difference among the three is how quickly the temperature
reverts back to equilibrium in the small eruption case (solid black and blue shading in
\cref{fig:compare-waveform-max}). However, when normalizing by enforcing all time series
to integrate to the same value, the tails of the temperature time series by construction
become similar across the three eruption magnitudes. From both of these two
normalizations, the amount of time spent at the peak temperature appears different. The
temperature from the smaller eruption simulation starts to revert sooner after it
reaches the peak temperature. The shape of the initial rise and the tail is more similar
across the three, while the peak is sharper in the small eruption case compared to the
two larger.

% NOTE: Any similar results that is consistent with a faster temperature recovery for
% weaker volcanic forcing? Not, sure, but one curiosity is that in the AOD signals, the
% smaller eruption spent more time at the peak, contrary to what seems to be the case
% for the temperature. The RF time series have similar shape for all forcing magnitudes.
% See figs. 9 (aod_arrays_normalized) and 10 (toa_arrays_normalized).

\subsection{Part 4}

Finally we compare all relevant parameters to each other. The initial input parameter to
the \ac{cesm2} is injected \ce{SO2}. Compared to \ac{aod} peak values we get an almost
linear relationship against \iso{}, shown in \cref{fig:so2_vs_aod}.\footnote{\emph{Since
    \iso{} is ``total amount of \iso{}'', maybe consider comparing to integrated values of
    \ac{aod}, \ac{rf} and temperature as well, not just the peak values.}} The latitude also
plays a role for how large the \ac{aod} perturbation becomes, as we can see from the
\ac{c2wsn} data point. The weak dependence on eruption latitude is also reported in
\citet{marshall2019}. \emph{Note: they say about 16\% of the variance is explained by
latitude, and 72\% by so2. Is it the same dependence?}

\begin{figure}[t]

  \end{center}
  \caption{Injected \ce{SO2} versus \ac{aod}}%
  \label{fig:so2_vs_aod}
\end{figure}

With the almost linear relation between injected \ce{SO2} and \ac{aod}, we should expect
to see a similar plot for \iso{} versus \ac{rf} as for \ac{aod} versus \ac{rf}. \iso[I]
versus \ac{rf} is shown in \cref{fig:so2_vs_toa}, but where the absolute value of the
\ac{rf} is potted along the \( y \)-axis. Just as in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full} we find
the \ac{cesm2} data points to be heavily damped in \ac{rf} as \iso{} increases. The same
effect can be seen in the data from \citet{ottobliesner2016} (labelled C1C, red points),
but here the \ac{rf} tend to bend off sooner, having a smaller \ac{rf} response to
\iso{} than the \ac{cesm2} data. The simulations used by \citet{ottobliesner2016} was
with \ac{cesm} as well, but version 1 (\ac{cesm1}) and with a low-top atmosphere
(\ac{cam5}). The difference in model complexity might thus be the reason why the \iso{}
give weaker \ac{rf} response for \citet{ottobliesner2016} than what we find.
\citet{niemeier2015} did simulations of continually emitting injections of sulphur, up
to \(\SI{100}{\tera\gram \mathrm{(S)}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\), and found that the impact of
increasing the injection rate lead to a \ac{rf} as a function of injection rate \(x\)
that had an exponential decay converging to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\)
\begin{equation}
  \Delta
  R_{\mathrm{TOA}} =
  -\SI{65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}
  \mathrm{e}^{-{\left(\frac{\SI{2246}{\tera\gram(S)yr^{-1}}}{x}\right)}^{0.23}}.
  \label{eq:niemeier_exponential}
\end{equation}
%
(\emph{Add that in \citet{timmreck2010} they simulate \ac{ytt} in two steps, starting
  from \(\SI{850}{\tera\gram(\mathrm{S})}\) (double that and you get \ce{SO2}), which gave
  them a peak \ac{aod} of about \(\num{4.286}\), \ac{rf} peak of
  \(\SI{18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) and temperature peak of \(\SI{3.5}{\kelvin}\). Almost
  exactly on the path of \cref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.})
The upper limit is close to what one might suspect the \ac{cesm2} peaks and the
\ac{p100} simulation peak to approach (pink square in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full}),
however, the functional shape is dissimilar; the exponential shape found by
\citet{niemeier2015} has a much slower decay than that of \ac{cesm2} and \ac{p100}.
Given the distinctive scenarios; a constant level of \iso{} in contrast to a specified
injected mass simulating a volcanic eruption, dissimilar forcings are expected.

  \label{fig:so2_vs_toa}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:so2_vs_temp} show \iso{} versus temperature response. Just as in
\cref{fig:so2_vs_toa}, the data from the \ac{cesm2} simulations bend off, making the
temperature response weaker for higher values of \iso. Again we see that the data from
the \ac{cesm1} simulations by \citet{ottobliesner2016} follow a different path than the
\ac{cesm2} data, with weaker temperature fluctuations for a given \iso{}, as one would
expect based on \cref{fig:so2_vs_toa}.

  \label{fig:so2_vs_temp}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:aod_vs_temp} should in the case of the \ac{cesm2} data points be akin in shape
to the paths found in \cref{fig:so2_vs_temp} due to the close to linear relationship
found between \iso{} and \ac{aod} in \cref{fig:so2_vs_aod}. The relationship between
\ac{aod} and temperature is slightly more linear than what is the case with \iso{} and
temperature, but the tendency is still the same.

  \label{fig:aod_vs_temp}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:toa_vs_temp} we compare the \ac{rf} and temperature response. Both the
\ac{cesm2} data and the \ac{cesm1} from \citet{ottobliesner2016} show a close to linear
relationship between temperature and \ac{rf}, but where the \ac{cesm2} data seem to lead
to stronger temperature perturbations compared to \ac{cesm1}. However, the overlap in
data points is not big, and the \ac{cesm2} data are too sparse to make strong
conclusions, in addition to the difference in model complexity.

While the \ac{p100} data have been comparable to the large \ac{cesm2} data point in both
\ac{aod} and \ac{rf}, the temperature response reported by \citet{jones2005} is much
stronger than what our strongest eruption caused. Since \citet{jones2005} used the
\ac{aod} forcing from Mt. Pinatubo multiplied by one hundred, the shape during the whole
phase could be notably different to what a super-eruption would create, even though the
peak is representable, as we have seen in \cref{fig:aod_arrays_normalized} where the
\ac{aod} shape differ as the eruption strength is increased. This might be enough to
cause a much stronger temperature perturbation. We also note that \citet{timmreck2010}
used a more realistic \ac{aod} forcing and obtained cooling that was much smaller than
\citet{jones2005}. \emph{(More on this in
  \cref{sec:discussion}\ref{sec:climate-sensitivity-estimate}.)}

\Cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full,fig:aod_vs_toa_inset,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled,fig:aod_vs_toa_logscale}
all show that as the \ac{aod} values are increased past \(\sim 0.5\), the scaling of
\(\sim -20\) no longer map to corresponding values of \ac{rf}. When looking at the
intermediate volcanic eruption with \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram}\) \iso{} there seem to be a
mostly linear relationship between the \ac{aod} and \ac{rf} values, with a slope of
approximately \(-10\). As for the largest eruption, scaling \ac{aod} by \(\sim-4\)
yields reasonable \ac{rf} values. From \cref{fig:so2_vs_aod} we have an almost linear
relation between \iso{} and \ac{aod}, and previous results indicate that larger
eruptions where more \ce{SO2} is injected creates larger aerosols which are less
effective at scattering radiation, making the cooling less efficient
\citep{english2013,timmreck2010,timmreck2018}. (\citet{timmreck2010} mention that for
very large eruptions, they look at Pinatubo and \ac{ytt}, \ce{OH} radicals are not
abundant enough which limit the \ce{SO2} oxidation. Originally in \citep{bekki1995}.)
The peak in \ac{aod} levels for the \ac{ytt} simulation appear six months after the peak
of Pinatubo (or a \ac{p100} scaling) in \citet{timmreck2010}, and at a much smaller
value, see their Fig.\ 1c. \citet{timmreck2010} also obtained a peak \ac{rf} anomaly of
\(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) (\(7\)-\(8\) months after) compared to \citet{jones2005}
of \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) (one year after). (\ac{rf} peak occurring before the
\ac{aod} peak is the same as I see with my simulations, especially with the larger
ones.)

From the smallest and the intermediate eruption sizes, an apparent roughly linear
relationship between \ac{aod} and \ac{rf} emerge. Only when inspecting the data
generated from the largest eruption at \(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram}\) of \iso{} can we see
that it initially follow approximately the same path as the intermediate, before it
continues on a shallower path. Yet, the path that the \ac{aod} and \ac{rf} data points
from the two eruptions follow is comparable when scaled, suggesting that the
intermediate also do follow a loop and that it is not just noise that causes the spread.
Importantly, there appear to be a time-after-eruption dependency on the ratio between
\ac{aod} and \ac{rf}. \citet{marshall2020} discuss a similar feature they find when
looking at \ac{aod} and \ac{rf}, but there, the efficiency increases from year 1 to year
2, while here efficiency decreases with time. \citet{marshall2020} explain that this is
due to the time it takes for the aerosols to spread which affects the global albedo and
in turn the \ac{rf}, while the \ac{aod} being less affected by the aerosols spreading.

% TODO: get out the three aerosol components to check growth and sedimentation

The ratio between \ac{aod} and \ac{rf} is not constant with time, and from
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio} we find that right after the eruption \ac{rf} is
particularly big relative to \ac{aod}, especially for the smaller eruptions.
\citet[][see their sections 3.1.2, 3.2.2]{marshall2019} describe how the growth of
aerosol particles affect both \ac{aod} and \ac{rf}, and introduce a suggested two phases
of the aerosol evolution, a ``growth'' phase and a ``sedimentation'' phase. In general
there are larger aerosols for larger eruptions (more time to grow), such that both
\ac{aod} and \ac{rf} will be weaker (they fall out due to gravity faster and are less
efficient at scattering radiation).
% WARN: I don't know if my understanding of the following is correct
In the later phase (``sedimentation'' phase) the dependence of \ac{rf} on \ac{aod}
becomes weaker since, in addition to a faster sedimentation rate, the \ac{rf} is further
reduced due to the larger aerosols being less effective at scattering \ac{sw} radiation.
These phases fall largely in line with the results in
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled}, where (1) the
larger eruptions have a smaller ratio (larger aerosols scatter \ac{sw} radiation more
poorly) and (2) the ratio is decreasing in magnitude as the eruption evolve (in the
early phase only, the later phase give a roughly constant ratio, see
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio}). Based on the simple two phases of the aerosol
evolution \citep{marshall2019}, an increasing \ac{rf} to \ac{aod} ratio (decreasing when
considering absolute values) seems reasonable.

An attempt to reason for the decrease in efficiency being more likely: smaller eruptions
and estimates from them give an \ac{rf} to \ac{aod} that is quite steep, while larger
eruptions (or values of \iso{} in the atmosphere as used in \citet{niemeier2015}) result
in estimates that are smaller in magnitude (\(\sim-20\) versus \(\sim-10\) to
\(\sim-4\), \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio}). \citet{niemeier2017} showed that the
efficiency decrease as the injection rate increase, which is related to the \ac{qbo},
and that large volcanic eruptions result in larger aerosol particle sizes which result
in decreasing cooling efficiency per \iso{} \citep{english2013, timmreck2018}. Can this
be used to reason that the efficiency is initially high, then decreasing? Perhaps
several and competing effects (albedo, \ac{qbo}, particle size, growth \& sedimentation
phases)?

Large compared to small eruptions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \ce{SO2} oxidises more slowly due to lack of \ce{OH}, which delays the peak \ac{aod}
        level
  \item Aerosols grow to larger radii, which makes them less efficient at scattering radiation,
        so you have less cooling for the same amount of \iso{}
  \item Larger aerosols stay for a shorter time due to being heavier (and other causes? Verify.)
  \item \ac{rf} plot (\cref{fig:toa_arrays_normalized}) show similar shape when they are scaled;
        smaller eruptions are more efficient throughout, but especially in the early phase, why?
        (\Cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio}.)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Climate sensitivity estimate}%
\label{sec:climate-sensitivity-estimate}

The climate feedback (sometimes response) parameter is estimated by \citet{jones2005} to
be \(\alpha \simeq \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\) (Still not sure how they do
this, you need constant forcing, no?), which was more than twice (and half the
sensitivity, since \(\alpha =1/s\) where \(s\) is the climate sensitivity parameter) of
what \citet{gregory2016} obtained in their simulations using Pinatubo in the HadCM3
climate model. (they used a step volcanic forcing simulation to obtain their estimate).

Instead of estimating \(\alpha \), we focus our attention to the climate resistance
\(\rho \), and the \ac{tcrp} \(1/\rho\) (where \(\mathrm{TCR}=F_{2\times}\times
\mathrm{TCRP}\) is the transient climate sensitivity). Even though the forcing from
volcanic eruptions last only for about a year, which is too short for the timescales at
which \(F=\rho T\) is valid \citep{gregory2016}, we may get around this by using a
time-integral form introduced by \citet{merlis2014}
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t=\rho\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \rho=\frac{\int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t}{\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t}.
  \label{eq:climate-resistance}
\end{equation}
%
If the upper bound of the integral, \(\tau \), is big enough such that the upper ocean
heat capacity is the same at \(t=0\) and \(t=\tau \), then this agrees with \(F=\rho T\)
\citep{gregory2016} (\citet{merlis2014} used \(\tau =\SI{15}{\mathrm{y}}\)). We also
note that the climate resistance and the climate feedback parameter are related to the
ocean heat uptake efficiency \(\kappa \) through \(\rho =\alpha +\kappa \).

When computing the trapezoidal integral of the forcing and temperature before finding
the ratio, the three tropical simulation cases (four in each ensemble) give estimated
\ac{tcrp} (\(1/\rho\)) of \(3.3\), \(3.12\) and \(2.91\), shown in \cref{tab:trcp}. The
parameter \(\rho\) is not the same as the climate feedback parameter \citet{jones2005}
estimated (\(\alpha\)), but as both \(\alpha \) and \(\kappa \) are positive, and our
estimates of \(\rho (=\alpha +\kappa) \) are all smaller than the \citet{jones2005}
estimate of \(\alpha \simeq \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), we conclude that the
climate feedback parameter related to the simulations performed here must be
substantially smaller than what \citet{jones2005} got.

\section*{Notes}

To-do:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\lbrack{}x\rbrack{}] Create an estimate of climate sensitivity from volcanoes.
    \citet{gregory2016} talks about what they got in \citet{jones2005}, so maybe comparing
    is worthwhile. \emph{Did find the \ac{tcrp} according to \citet{merlis2014}, which gives
      some ground for comparison, but the climate feedback parameter is missing.}
  \item[\lbrack{}x\rbrack{}] Create plots also using the \(1-\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{AOD}}\), like
    in Marshall et al.\ (2020). \emph{For data greater than 1, the scaling squishes it a
      lot.}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Climate sensitivity estimate}

From \citet{gregory2016}: ``The peak forcing was about \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\),
only \(20\) times greater than Pinatubo, and the climate feedback parameter \(\alpha
\simeq \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), more than twice the value (half the
climate sensitivity parameter [which is the reciprocal?]) that we found for Pinatubo in
HadCM3.''

\(1/\rho \) is the ``transient climate response parameter'' (where
\(\mathrm{TCR}=F_{2\times}\times \mathrm{TCRP}\) is the transient climate sensitivity),
where \(\rho \) is a climate resistance obtained from \(F(t)=\rho T(t)\), where the
forcing increase at a roughly constant rate.

The climate feedback parameter \(\alpha\) and the ocean heat uptake efficiency
\(\kappa\) are both positive, and \(\rho =\alpha +\kappa \). In this picture, \(T\) is a
surface skin temperature, with negligible thermal inertia, determined by the Earth
energy balance \(F=N+\alpha T\), where \(N\) is the net downward radiative heat flux at
the top of the atmosphere, and \(N=\kappa T\) if we neglect heat storage other than in
the ocean. We call \(F=\rho T\) the ``zero-layer model''.

``For volcanic forcing which is large in magnitude for only a year or two, the
\ac{tcrp} and the zero-layer model are therefore not applicable.'' They
\citep{gregory2016} use an abruptPin simulation to estimate the climate feedback
parameter \(\alpha \) for volcanic forcing in comparison to forcing from for example
\(4\times \ce{CO2}\). Possible to use method outlined by \citet{merlis2014}? That is,

\citet{gregory2016} use \(F=N+\alpha T\) while \citet{jones2005} use \(Q=N+\lambda
\Delta T\) to describe the same thing. Also, \citet{merlis2014} is using
\(\tilde{\beta}=\rho\), \(\beta =\alpha =\lambda \), \(\gamma =\kappa \) and
\(\mathcal{F}=F\). See \cref{tab:symbol-comparison}.
