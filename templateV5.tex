\section{Outline}

The paper should provide insight about what might happen if a very large (order of
magnitude or more than Mount Pinatubo) volcanic eruption happened (for example within
the next 50 years). It should also be about how volcanic simulations compare in
magnitude and model complexity (dynamic ocean against slab ocean). If there is no big
difference, we may also run more experiments to test for other things:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How does the climate response change based on the state of the climate: what if we run
        a \ce{CO2} doubling or quadrupling simulation until close to equilibrium, and let the
        volcanoes erupt then?
  \item How much does it matter how high in the atmosphere the initial \ce{SO2} is injected?
  \item How far does the linear relation between \acrshort{aod} and \acrshort{toa} go?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Introduction}

The introduction should go into some detail about:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Importance of volcanic eruptions for temperature fluctuations
  \item Refer back to other simulations of volcanoes, for example the \citet{jones2005} paper
        that ran a super-volcano, or \citet{gregory2016} who looked at historic volcanoes
        during the last 150 years only
  \item The temperature response might be more sensitive to the sign of the forcing, rather
        than the forcing agent, and as such a halving of \ce{CO2} may be compared with
        volcanoes \citep{gunther2022}
  \item How important is it that \ce{SO2} is injected at a given height?
  \item To some extent there should be a literature review of the above, so more citations and
        references are needed.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: we should have a section for method as well, and maybe also write about what the
% results and discussion should include

\section{Method}

Let us first introduce some figures.

There are three different forcing magnitudes that have been used. The figures below
show two alternative ways of normalizing the temperature response to these volcanic
events.

First, we have the three temperature responses normalized by setting the peak value
equal to one, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:temp_norm_max}. The second method of
normalizing, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:temp_norm_int}, is to numerically integrate the
time series, and divide through such that they integrate to one.
