\section{Outline}

The paper should be about the volcanic simulations that compare magnitude and model
complexity (dynamic ocean against slab ocean). If there is no big difference, we may
also run more experiments to test for other things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How does the climate response change based on the state of the climate: what
	      if we run a \ce{CO2} doubling or quadrupling simulation until close to
	      equilibrium, and let the volcanoes erupt then?
	\item How much does it matter how high in the atmosphere the initial \ce{SO2} is
	      injected?
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}

Let us first introduce some figures.

% ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \acknowledgments

% Keep acknowledgments (note correct spelling: no ``e'' between the ``g'' and ``m'') as
% brief as possible. In general, acknowledge only direct help in writing or research.
% Financial support (e.g., grant numbers) for the work done, for an author, or for the
% laboratory where the work was performed is best acknowledged here rather than as
% footnotes to the title or to an author's name. Contribution numbers (if the work has
% been published by the author's institution or organization) should be included as
% footnotes on the title page, not in the acknowledgments.

% DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \datastatement

% The data availability statement is where authors should describe how the data underlying
% the findings within the article can be accessed and reused. Authors should attempt to
% provide unrestricted access to all data and materials underlying reported findings. If
% data access is restricted, authors must mention this in the statement.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% APPENDIXES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Use \appendix if there is only one appendix.
%\appendix

% Use \appendix[A], \appendix[B], if you have multiple appendixes.
%\appendix[A]

%% Appendix title is necessary! For appendix title:
%\appendixtitle{}

%%% Appendix section numbering (note, skip \section and begin with \subsection)
% \subsection{First primary heading}

% \subsubsection{First secondary heading}

% \paragraph{First tertiary heading}

%% Important!
%\appendcaption{<appendix letter and number>}{<caption>}
%must be used for figures and tables in appendixes, e.g.,
%
%\begin{figure}
%\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figure01.pdf}\\
%\appendcaption{A1}{Caption here.}
%\end{figure}
%
% All appendix figures/tables should be placed in order AFTER the main figures/tables, i.e., tables, appendix tables, figures, appendix figures.
