\section{Outline}

The paper should provide insight about what might happen if a large volcano erupted
(order of magnitude or more than Mount Pinatubo). \emph{Little literature has been found
  that investigate the effects of eruptions ten times or more than that of Mount Pinatubo,
  so this should hopefully be worthwhile looking into.} How does the atmosphere react, for
example in the aerosol dynamics? (\acrshort{qbo}, \iso{}/\acrshort{aod}/\acrshort{rf}
relationship.) It should also be about how volcanic simulations compare in magnitude and
if there is time for more simulations, how model complexity (dynamic ocean against slab
ocean) affect things.
\begin{itemize}
  \item How far does the linear relation between \acrshort{aod} and \acrshort{rf} go? What
        phases does the aerosols go though? (Perhaps the most promising avenue.)
  \item How much does it matter how high in the atmosphere the initial \ce{SO2} is injected?
        (Already is some literature on this, suggesting it is not much. Also some on latitude
        dependence, which has a bigger influence.)
  \item How does the climate response change based on the state of the climate: what if we run a
        \ce{CO2} doubling or quadrupling simulation until close to equilibrium, and let the
        volcanoes erupt then? (Lack the doubling scenario, and setting it up has resulted in
        strange output that must be resolved. Could take a while.)
\end{itemize}

The introduction should go into some detail about:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Volcanic eruption aerosol evolution (in relation to \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop} for
        example)
  \item The temperature response might be more sensitive to the sign of the forcing, rather than
        the forcing agent, and as such a halving of \ce{CO2} may be compared with volcanoes
        \citep{gunther2022}
  \item How important is it that \ce{SO2} is injected at a given height? (Not very:
        \citet{marshall2019})
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction and Motivation}

During much of the past few thousand years, the Holocene, the natural climate
variability on Earth have been mostly forced by volcanic eruptions \citep{sigl2022}.
Despite the strong influence volcanic eruptions have on climate variability, in
particular up to the current strong anthropogenic forcing of the climate, few climate
model experiments have included volcanic forcing estimates when simulating climate
evolution \citep{sigl2022}, implying an incorrect positive forcing \citep{gregory2016}.
Thus, even though understanding how volcanic eruptions force the climate has been given
much attention, many questions still remain unanswered
\citep[e.g.,][]{robock2000,zanchettin2019,marshall2022}.

% NOTE: perhaps join these two sections with papers looking at similarities between CO2
% and volcanic forcing. (feedback params references)

One avenue that have been given much attention is how forcing from volcanoes or
volcano-like forcings compare to the forcing that is due to increased \ce{CO2} levels.
\citet{boer2007,marvel2016,merlis2014,ollila2016,richardson2019,salvi2022,wigley2005}
all attempt to link volcanic forcing to climate sensitivity to a doubling of \ce{CO2}, a
much used metric for describing the severity of global warming \citep{marvel2016}. This
is motivated by the large uncertainty in estimates of the sensitivity of the real
climate system, and inferring climate sensitivity from for example volcanoes have been
used in an attempt to constrain the sensitivity \citep{boer2007}. Among these, some have
been running simulations of the 1991 Mt.\ Pinatubo eruption
\citep{merlis2014,ollila2016} or historical volcano or volcano-like forcings
\citep{boer2007,marvel2016,wigley2005}, while some look at aerosol forcing in general
\citep{richardson2019,salvi2022}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Boer did sims using volcano-like eruptions: changed solar constant according to
      en exponential. This also means complete "ash-cover". Sensitivity need not be
      constant, so sensitivity for short timescale volcano-perturbations is different
      from ECS. Claims it might be possible to infer climate sensitivity if the forcing
      and heat storage is known (but not temperature alone). MAYBE WITH HIGH PRECISION
  \item Marvel used sims where many kinds were represented, among others idealized
      volcano simulations. Talk about ERF as opposed to IRF...
  \item Merlis ran an ensemble of SAOD forced Pinatubo eruptions and compared with 2xCO2
      and 0.5xCo2
  \item Ollila looked at Pinatubo in a dynamical model, so not a GCM
  \item Richardson compared many different sims setups, where 5xSO4 was one of them,
      that is, 5 times sulfate aerosol concentrations or emissions, as a step function
  \item Salvi ran simulations of historical aerosols, but this does not mean natural
      volcanic aerosols it seems
  \item Wigley used an ensemble of historic volcanoes, 1890 to 2000, output of AOGCMs,
      and ran en upwelling diffusion EBM to emulate an AOGCM
\end{itemize}

% Section on RF to AOD ratio

Previous studies on both Mt. Pinatubo alone \citep{mills2017,hansen2005} and volcanoes
in the instrumental era \citep{gregory2016} have been used to estimate the relationship
between the energy imbalance caused by volcanic eruptions and \acrshort{aod}.
\citet{myhre2013} use a formula for \acrshort{rf} that scales \acrshort{aod} by
\(\SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{SAOD}^{-1}}\) while values down to
\(\SI{-19.0(5)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{SAOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{gregory2016} and
\(\SI{-18.3(10)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{SAOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{mills2017} have been
reported more recently. Simulations done with synthetic volcanoes have also been used,
and in \citet{marshall2020} they simulate a total of \(82\) volcanic eruptions with
varying injection height and latitude, ranging from \(10\) to \(\SI{100}{\tera\gram}\)
of \iso{}. They obtain a scaling factor of
\(\SI{-20.5(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{SAOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{marshall2020}.

A similar simulation setup, albeit with significant differences, was done by
\citet{niemeier2015}, where \(14\) different levels of injected sulphur ranging between
\(\SI{1}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) and
\(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) was simulated. These were
geoengineering simulations where sulphur would be continually injected, and the
simulations run until the sulphur level was in a steady state. From this, they found
that the radiative forcing to injecting rate ratio would follow an exponential and
converge to a value of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\). While the results from the
super-volcano simulation by \citet{jones2005} indicate a much less steep gradient than
the \(-18.3\) to \(-25\) found in more recent literature, the peak radiative forcing
obtained in the super-volcano simulation was \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\), which may
suggest the \citet{niemeier2015} results to be transferable to a volcanic eruption
simulation scenario.

% TODO: include these notes better in the introduction

\citet{marshall2022} mention (in the graphic in their figure 1) that the \emph{role of
  initial conditions} is a key outstanding question, especially if the \ce{CO2}
doubling simulations work out, this could be a contribution to that.
Also, when aerosols grow, they scatter radiation less efficiently and also fall down
faster, so the temperature response should be comparatively weaker for increasing
eruption magnitude (or the volcanic aerosols are less efficient). \emph{Clustering} and
long term effects are mentioned in its own section (Multi-decadal impacts) along with
the \emph{dependence of the current climate state}.

\citet{marshall2019} does many similar things to what I have done, but do not focus on
seasonal variability. This is however mentioned as one other direction to dig into, but
is somewhat covered by \citet{marshall2020}. Assumes that there is an $e$-folding time,
but notes that it does change, so they calculate an average time over a small range
(from a month after the peak until reaching ten percent of the peak). They further note
that the $e$-folding time is dependent on latitude mostly, but also on injected
\ce{SO2}. Their eruptions all occur in July, but with the equivalent winter (January)
eruptions covered by \citet{marshall2020}.

In \citet{marshall2020}, they take the reconstructed \acrshort{saod} from
\citet{toohey2017}, convert it to radiative forcing based on their conversions, and plot
the corresponding temperature time series from each radiative forcing using a simple
climate model. \emph{So, can we use this with the \acrfull{fpp} framework? (Noisy data?
  Check this.)}
% TODO: check the data if it can be used for FPP.

Perhaps focus on why there seems to be a loop in the \acrshort{aod} against
\acrshort{rf} plots. Can also compare February-August means with May-November means.
(\citet{marshall2021} discuss Tambora, but mention that it erupted in April, while their
data consist of January and July eruptions.)

\section{Method}

\subsection{Output variables}

Radiative forcing is calculated as the combined (\acrshort{sw} and \acrshort{lw})
all-sky \acrshort{toa} energy imbalance, where the \acrshort{cesm2} provide the output
variables \acrfull{fsnt} and \acrfull{flnt}. We thus get that \(\mathrm{RF_*}=
\mathrm{FSNT} - \mathrm{FLNT}\) and taking the difference between volcanic simulations
and a control simulation gives the final estimate of \acrshort{rf}
(\(\mathrm{RF}=\mathrm{RF_{VOLC}}-\mathrm{RF_{CONTROL}}\)) \citep{marshall2020}. The
\acrshort{aod} is obtained from the output variable \acrfull{aodm}, while global
temperature is saved by \acrshort{cesm2} to the variable \acrfull{trefht}. These four
output variables are all that are used throughout this paper. The important input data
used in the model simulations are \iso{} in units of tera grams, used to simulate
volcanic eruptions.

\subsection{Model}

We are using the \acrfull{cesm2} \citep{danabasoglu2020} to run our climate simulations,
together with the \acrfull{waccm} \citep{gettleman2019} and the fully dynamical ocean
component \acrfull{pop} \citep{smith2010, danabasoglu2020}. The complete list of model
components is found in \cref{tab:cesm-components}. The model atmosphere was run at
nominal \(\SI{2}{\degree}\) resolution, with \(70\) vertical levels, in the \acrfull{ma}
configuration.

The \acrshort{ma} version of \acrshort{waccm} uses the \acrfull{mam3}
\citep{gettleman2019}. This was made as a simplified and computationally efficient
default setting in the \acrshort{cam5} \citep{liu2016}, and is described in
\citet{liu2012}. The \acrshort{mam3} was created from MAM7 (seven modes) by merging the
primary carbon mode with the accumulation mode, and assuming instantaneous internal
mixing of primary carbonaceous aerosols with secondary aerosols \citep{liu2016}.
Specifically, the three modes are Aitken, accumulation and coarse (MAM7 includes Aitken,
accumulation, primary carbon, fine dust and fine sea salt, coarse dust and coarse sea
salt modes) \citep{liu2016}. Instantaneous ageing of primary carbonaceous particles is
assumed by emitting them in the accumulation mode. There are \(15\) transported aerosol
tracers in \acrshort{mam3} \citep{liu2016}. \citet{marshall2019, marshall2020,
  marshall2021} used a code with seven log-normal modes to simulate aerosol mass and
number concentrations, but their model is an \acrfull{agcm}, as opposed to the
\acrshort{cesm2} which is an \acrfull{esm} or \acrfull{aogcm}.

Since dust absorbs water well it is expected to be removed by wet deposition almost as
well as sea salt, which should make the course mode (mode 3, of which sea salt and soil
dust are both part of) revert quickly to its background state below the tropopause
\citep{liu2012}. Similarly, fine dust and fine sea salt are both merged into the
accumulation mode (mode 2). \emph{\citet{liu2012} says the accumulation mode is roughly
  $90\%$ of the sulfate burden, which I don't really get from my figures. Hmm, need to
  look more into this.}

% NOTE: maybe Maria have an idea?

\subsection{Simulation set up}

Simulations were created using a modified version of the file
\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl},
% \href{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl}{\texttt{createVolcEruptV3.ncl}}
via a Python project developed on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking}. The project is also available from the
Python package manager PyPI, as \texttt{pip install volcano-cooking}. This creates
volcanoes with a given \ce{SO2} amount that is injected over six
hours\footnote{\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl}}
at a given altitude, latitude and longitude. All volcanic \ce{SO2} files are created by
setting the eruption details in a \texttt{JSON} file that is read to the
\texttt{volcano-cooking} CLI at a fixed version, making the experiment setup highly
reproducible.

We are using the \texttt{BWma1850} component
setup\footnote{\url{https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/config/2.1.0/compsets.html}}
to run the \acrshort{cesm2}, and an accompanying \acrfull{fsst} simulation to obtain
estimates of the radiative forcing. The \acrshort{fsst} simulation used is not from a
standardised component setup as of \acrshort{cesm2} (v2.1.3), but is instead specified
in full as (\texttt{BWma1850} full name also shown for comparison)
\begin{small}
  \begin{verbatim}
BWma1850 ->
  1850_CAM60%WCCM_CLM50%BGC-CROP_CICE_
  POP2%ECO%NDEP_MOSART_CISM2%NOEVOLVE_WW3
fSST1850 ->
  1850_CAM60%WCCM_CLM50%BGC-CROP_CICE%PRES_
  DOCN%DOM_MOSART_CISM2%NOEVOLVE_SWAV_TEST
  \end{verbatim}
\end{small}
They differ in \texttt{CICE -> CICE\%PRES}, which is prescribed sea-ice,
\texttt{POP2\%ECO\%DEP -> DOCN\%DOM} which is from a dynamical ocean to a prescribed
data ocean and the wave component \texttt{WW3 -> SWAV} which is now a stub wave
component instead of the full \acrfull{ww3}.

\subsection{Simulations}

The simulations are summarized in \cref{tab:simulation-overview} and cover three
\ce{SO2} injection magnitudes and four seasons; 15 February, 15 May, 15 August and 15
November. The magnitudes vary across three orders of magnitude: \(\SI{26}{\tera\gram}\),
\(\SI{400}{\tera\gram}\) and \(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram}\). The smallest eruption is of the
same order of magnitude as Mount Pinatubo
\citep[\(\sim10\)--\(\SI{20}{\tera\gram}\);~e.g.][]{timmreck2018} and Mount Tambora
\citep[\(\sim\SI{56.2}{\tera\gram}\);~e.g.][]{zanchettin2016}, the intermediate is
similar to the 1257 Samalas eruption \citep[\(\sim
  119\)--\(\SI{250}{\tera\gram}\);~e.g.][]{toohey2017,ottobliesner2016}, and the largest
is similar to the Young Toba Tuff eruption
\citep[\(10\)--\(\SI{10000}{\tera\gram}\);][and~references~therein]{jones2005}. They are
all located at the equator, at \(\SI{0}{\degree N}\), \(\SI{1}{\degree E}\) and \ce{SO2}
is injected between \(\SI{18}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{20}{\kilo\meter}\).

\section{Results}

\subsection{Forcing magnitudes}

There are three different forcing magnitudes that have been used. The figures below show
two alternative ways of normalizing the temperature response to these volcanic events.

First, we have the three temperature responses normalized by setting the peak value
equal to one, shown in \cref{fig:temp_norm_max}. The second method of normalizing, shown
in \cref{fig:temp_norm_int}, is to numerically integrate the time series, and divide
through such that they integrate to one.

When normalizing by setting their amplitude equal to (minus) one, the initial rise
across all three is comparable. The difference among the three is now how much more
quickly the temperature reverts back to equilibrium in the small eruption case.

On the other hand, when normalizing by enforcing all to integrate to the same value, the
tail of the temperature time series is what is most similar across the three eruptions.
From these two normalizations, one thing that stays different is the amount of time
spent at the peak temperature. The temperature from the smaller eruption simulation
starts to revert sooner after it reaches temperatures close to the peak temperature. The
shape of the initial rise and the tail is more similar across the three, while the peak
is sharper in the small eruption case compared to the two larger. \emph{ Any similar
  results that is consistent with a faster temperature recovery for weaker volcanic
  forcing? Not, sure, but one curiosity is that in the \acrshort{aod} signals, the smaller
  eruption spent more time at the peak, contrary to what seems to be the case for the
  temperature. The \acrshort{rf} time series have similar shape for all forcing
  magnitudes. See \cref{fig:aod_arrays_normalized,fig:toa_arrays_normalized}.}

\subsection{Parameter scan}

Whether the temperature time series have different shape depending on forcing strength
or not is a natural next step to take, and we here look more closely into the different
forcings. This comparison is also motivated by \citet{gregory2016}, specifically their
figure 4 which compare annual mean \acrfull{aod} with \acrfull{rf}.
\Cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full} show annual mean values from the three simulation cases along
with the gradient obtained by \citet{gregory2016} of \(-19\). The annual mean data from
the smallest Pinatubo-like eruption (blue downward facing triangles,
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_inset}) has \acrshort{rf} values compared to \acrshort{aod} that
nicely follow the same constant gradient as the \citet{gregory2016} data used in their
figure 4.

However, we do find that the stronger eruptions lead to very different responses in
\acrshort{aod} and \acrshort{rf}, where the slope of the intermediate seem to follow
close to a \( -10 \) gradient and the strong is closer to a \( -4 \) gradient. The peak
values (red circles) suggest a logarithmic looking functional shape dependence, while
within each eruption strength the annual mean values fall relatively close to on a
straight line, but does tend to draw an elongated loop. This is the case also for the
small eruption strength shown in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_inset}.

Focusing on the peaks as shown by the red circles, previous papers simulating similar
effects have found the same trend. \citet{niemeier2015} did simulations of continually
emitting injections of sulphur, up to \( \SI{100}{\tera\gram
  \mathrm{(S)}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}} \), and found that the impact of increasing the injection
rate lead to a radiative forcing as a function of injection rate that had an exponential
decay and that converged to \( \SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}} \)
\begin{equation}
  \Delta
  R_{\mathrm{TOA}} =
  -\SI{65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}
  \mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{\SI{2246}{\tera\gram(S)yr^{-1}}}{x}\right)^{0.23}}.
  \label{eq:niemeier_exponential}
\end{equation}
This upper limit is close to what one might suspect the \acrshort{cesm2} peaks and the
\acrfull{p100} simulation peak to approach (pink square in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full}),
however, the functional shape is very different; the exponential found by
\citet{niemeier2015} have a much slower decay than what the \acrshort{cesm2} and
\acrshort{p100} data might follow. Given the very different scenarios; a constant level
of \iso{} in contrast to a specified injected mass simulating a volcanic eruption, it
should not be too surprising that the responses are different.

\subsection{Forcing efficiency}

\emph{Related to \citet{marshall2020}: ``We find that the conversion between
  \acrshort{saod} and ERF depends on the time after an eruption, \dots''. ``Forcing per
  unit \acrshort{saod} is weaker in Year 1 than in Years 2 and 3 \dots'', does this make
  sense relative to my results? It looks like it is opposite! But they also represent
  \acrshort{saod} somewhat differently from me: \( 1-\exp(-\mathrm{SAOD}) \).}

To further look into the responses in \acrshort{aod} and \acrshort{rf} due to the
differently sized volcanic eruptions, we plot in
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_scaled,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled}
seasonal means where the start of the time series are shifted so that the eruption day
is at time zero, and all time series are exactly four years long.

% TODO: get out the three aerosol components to check growth and sedimentation

The ratio between \acrshort{aod} and \acrshort{rf} is not constant, but what is more is
that their ratio seem to draw a loop. Especially when the eruptions are very large,
\citet[][see their sections 3.1.2, 3.2.2]{marshall2019} describe how the growth of
aerosol particles affect both parameters. They introduce a suggested two phases of the
aerosol evolution, a ``growth'' phase and a ``sedimentation'' phase. In general there
are larger aerosols for larger eruptions (more time to grow), such that both
\acrshort{aod} and \acrshort{rf} will be weaker (they fall out due to gravity faster and
are less efficient at scattering radiation). In the later phase (``sedimentation''
phase) \acrshort{rf} become more weak compared to \acrshort{aod} since, in addition to a
faster sedimentation rate, the \acrshort{rf} is further reduced due to the larger
aerosols being less effective at scattering \acrshort{sw} radiation. This is largely in
line with the results in
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_scaled,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled},
where (1) the larger eruptions have a smaller ratio (larger aerosols scatter
\acrshort{sw} radiation more poorly) and (2) the ratio is decreasing in magnitude as the
eruption evolve (in the early phase only, the later phase give a roughly constant ratio,
see \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio}). Based on the simple two phases of the aerosol
evolution \citep{marshall2019}, an increasing \acrshort{rf} to \acrshort{aod} ratio
(decreasing when considering absolute values) seems reasonable.

\emph{\citet[][their figure 1c,d]{marshall2020} appear to have results suggesting that
  \acrshort{rf} should be larger later after the eruption than \acrshort{aod}, not weaker.
  Why this difference?}

  }%
  \label{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_scaled}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio} we plot the ratio of the annual means of
\acrshort{rf} and \acrshort{aod}. The years where the signal-to-noise ratio is best is
in years 1 and 2, as well as years 0 and 3 (mostly due to the \acrshort{rf} time series,
shown in \cref{fig:toa_arrays_normalized}). For this reason, the ratio of \acrshort{rf}
to \acrshort{aod} is calculated for the second season of the first year until the end of
the third year. From this we find that even though the ratio changes between the
eruption magnitudes, we do find that the gradient at which the ratio is changing is
similar across large eruption magnitudes. A slope of approximately \( 5.8 \) is a good
fit for both the intermediate (orange thick diamonds) and the strong eruption (green
upward triangles), and even though the spread in the small eruption (blue downward
triangles) is large in the \( y \)-direction, they tend to follow a similarly inclined,
albeit steeper, slope. In the later phase, from the second season of the second year,
the ratios stay close to constant for the reminder of the decaying phase.

The change in ratio, where the smallest is found in the strong eruption and the largest
ratio is from the small eruption, is consistent with the change in peak values seen in
\cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full}, where the red circles show the peak values are bending off
to the right. The \acrshort{rf} increase in magnitude slows down while \acrshort{aod}
increases close to linearly with injected \ce{SO2} (see also \cref{fig:so2_vs_aod}).
This could be the result of larger aerosols having time to develop as the amount of
injected \ce{SO2} increase \citep{marshall2019}. This in turn might make the forcing
from smaller eruptions relatively more efficient than from large eruptions, causing a
larger ratio between \acrshort{rf} and \acrshort{aod}.

  \label{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio}
\end{figure}

    \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop}
  }%
  \label{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio_scaled}
\end{figure}

One feature seen in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop,fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratio} is that
the early phase seem to have a \acrshort{rf} to \acrshort{aod} ratio that is changing
(from about \( 0 \) to \( 1.2 \) years after the eruption), while the later phase has an
almost constant ratio (from \( 1.2 \) to \( 3 \)--\( 4 \) years after the eruption).
When plotting the \acrshort{rf} time series we find that their shape is very consistent
over different eruption strengths (\cref{fig:toa_arrays_normalized}), but the
\acrshort{aod} time series show a slight change in shape from smaller to larger
eruptions (\cref{fig:aod_arrays_normalized}). Specifically, the \acrshort{aod} time
series from the smallest eruptions have a fast rise and a flat peak before it decays
back to its equilibrium state, while from the two larger eruptions we find a slower rise
time, but a sharper peak, making the decay to equilibrium happen at a similar time after
the eruption and at a similar rate. \emph{Why? \citet{marshall2019} and references
  therein may be the best source for a suggested explanation.}

An interesting aspect with the similar decaying phase seen in both the \acrshort{aod}
time series and the \acrshort{rf} time series is how this might influence the
temperature time series, and whether one would expect a similar trend in them. That is,
if one might expect the temperature time series to have different shape in the rising
phase, but similar shape in the decaying phase, as discussed in relation to
\cref{fig:temp_norm_max,fig:temp_norm_int}. Allowing the simulations to run for at least
twenty years to allow the tail to be well resolved is therefore another avenue that
could be explored further.

\subsection{Comparing parameters}

Let us finally compare all relevant parameters to each other. The initial parameter that
is the input to the \acrshort{cesm2} is injected \ce{SO2}. Compared to \acrshort{aod} we
find that the \acrshort{cesm2} simulations result in an almost linear relationship
between them, shown in \cref{fig:so2_vs_aod}.\footnote{\emph{Since \iso{} is ``total
    amount of \iso{}'', maybe consider comparing to integrated values of \acrshort{aod},
    \acrshort{rf} and temperature as well, not just the peak values.}} The latitude also
play a role for how large the \acrshort{aod} perturbation become, as we can see from the
\textbf{C2WN\(\uparrow\)} data point, representing a strong eruption, but located at \(
\SI{56}{\degree N} \). The weak dependence on eruption latitude is also reported in
\citet{marshall2019}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/injection_vs_aod.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Injected \ce{SO2} versus \acrshort{aod}}%
  \label{fig:so2_vs_aod}
\end{figure}

With the almost linear relation between injected \ce{SO2} and \acrshort{aod}, we should
expect to see a similar plot for \iso{} versus \acrshort{rf} as for \acrshort{aod}
versus \acrshort{rf}. \iso[I] versus \acrshort{rf} is shown in \cref{fig:so2_vs_toa},
but where the absolute value of the \acrshort{rf} is potted along the \( y \)-axis. Just
as in \cref{fig:aod_vs_toa_full} we find the \acrshort{cesm2} data points to be heavily
damped in \acrshort{rf} compared to \iso. The same effect can be seen in the data from
\citet{ottobliesner2016} (labelled \textbf{C1C}, red points), but here the \acrshort{rf}
tend to bend off sooner, having a smaller \acrshort{rf} response to \iso{} than the
\acrshort{cesm2} data has. The simulations used by \citet{ottobliesner2016} was with
\acrshort{cesm} as well, but version 1 (\acrshort{cesm1}) and with a low-top atmosphere
(\acrshort{cam5}). The difference in model complexity might therefore be the reason why
the \iso{} give weaker \acrshort{rf} response for \citet{ottobliesner2016} then what we
find.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/injection_vs_toa.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Injected \ce{SO2} versus \acrshort{rf} radiative imbalance}%
  \label{fig:so2_vs_toa}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:so2_vs_temp} show \iso{} versus temperature response. Just as in
\cref{fig:so2_vs_toa}, the data from the \acrshort{cesm2} simulations bend off, making
the temperature response less extreme for higher values of \iso. Again we see that the
data from the \acrshort{cesm1} simulations by \citet{ottobliesner2016} follow a
different path than the \acrshort{cesm2} data, with weaker temperature fluctuations for
a given \iso{}, as one would expect based on \cref{fig:so2_vs_toa}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/injection_vs_temperature.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Injected \ce{SO2} versus temperature}%
  \label{fig:so2_vs_temp}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:aod_vs_temp} should in the case of the \acrshort{cesm2} data points be very
similar in shape to the paths found in \cref{fig:so2_vs_temp} due to the close to linear
relationship found between \iso{} and \acrshort{aod} in \cref{fig:so2_vs_aod}. The
relationship between \acrshort{aod} and temperature is slightly more linear than what is
the case with \iso{} and temperature, but the tendency is still the same.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/aod_vs_toa_logscale.png}

\begin{figure}[t]

  \end{center}
  \caption{\acrshort{aod} versus temperature}%
  \label{fig:aod_vs_temp}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:toa_vs_temp} we compare the \acrshort{rf} and temperature response. Both
the \acrshort{cesm2} data and the \acrshort{cesm1} from \citet{ottobliesner2016} show a
close to linear relationship between temperature and \acrshort{rf}, but where the
\acrshort{cesm2} data seem to lead to stronger temperature perturbations compared to
\acrshort{cesm1}. However, the overlap in data is not big, and the \acrshort{cesm2} data
is too sparse to make strong conclusions, in addition to the difference in model
complexity.

While the \acrshort{p100} data have been comparable to the strong \acrshort{cesm2} data
point in both \acrshort{aod} and \acrshort{rf}, the temperature response reported by
\citet{jones2005} is much stronger than what our strongest eruption caused. Since
\citet{jones2005} used the \acrshort{aod} forcing from Mt. Pinatubo multiplied by one
hundred, the shape during the whole phase could be significantly different to what a
super-eruption would create, even though the peak is representable, as we have seen in
\cref{fig:aod_arrays_normalized} where the \acrshort{aod} shape differ as the eruption
strength is increased. This might be enough to cause a much stronger temperature
perturbation.
