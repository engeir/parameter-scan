\begin{abstract}
  We investigate the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions spanning from Mt.\
  Pinatubo-sized events to super-volcanoes. The study is based on ensemble simulations
  in the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) climate model using the Whole
  Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6) atmosphere model. Our analysis
  focuses on the impact of different \ce{SO2}-amount injections on stratospheric aerosol
  optical depth (AOD), effective radiative forcing (RF), and global temperature
  anomalies. Unlike the traditional linear models used for smaller eruptions, our
  results reveal a non-linear relationship between RF and AOD for larger eruptions. We
  also uncover a notable time-dependent decrease in aerosol forcing efficiency across
  all eruption magnitudes during the first post-eruption year. In addition, the study
  reveals that larger as compared to medium-sized eruption events produce a delayed and
  sharper peak in AOD, and a longer-lasting temperature response while the time
  evolution of RF remains similar between the two eruption types. When including the
  results of previous studies, we find that relating \ce{SO2} to any other parameter is
  inconsistent across models compared to the relationships between AOD, RF, and
  temperature anomaly. Thus, we expect the largest uncertainty in model codes to relate
  to the chemistry and physics of \ce{SO2} evolution.

Effective radiative forcing (RF) and stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) are
crucial metrics representing the energy imbalance at top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and the
stratospheric opacity due to aerosol scattering, respectively. They are extensively used
to quantify the impact of major volcanic eruptions. The assumption of a linear
dependency of RF on AOD is commonly adopted \cite{myhre2013,andersson2015}, and applying
such a linear relationship has yielded reasonably accurate estimates in climate model
simulations of volcanic eruptions
\cite{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Yet, a wide spread in
the estimated aerosol forcing efficiencies (RF normalised by AOD) exists among studies,
spanning approximately from \(\sim \SI{-15}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\)
\cite{pitari2016b} to \(\sim \SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\) \cite{myhre2013}.
Additionally, these estimates are predominantly based on small eruptions with AOD values
up to at most \(\sim 0.7\).

Although \ce{H2O}, \ce{N2}, and \ce{CO2} are the most abundant gases emitted by
volcanoes \cite{robock2000}, sulphur species such as \ce{SO2} provide a greater
influence due to the comparatively high background concentrations of the former gases in
the atmosphere. The transformation of \ce{SO2} molecules through reactions with \ce{OH}
and \ce{H2O} leads to the formation of sulphuric acid (\ce{H2SO4}) \cite{robock2000},
which scatters sunlight thereby elevating planetary albedo and reducing the RF. As the
conversion from \ce{SO2} to \ce{H2SO4} occurs over weeks \cite{robock2000}, the peak RF
experiences a slight delay from the eruption's peak \ce{SO2} injection. The lifetime of
the \ce{H2SO4} aerosols in the stratosphere depends on various factors, including
latitude \cite{marshall2019, toohey2019}, volcanic plume height \cite{marshall2019},
aerosol size \cite{marshall2019}, the quasi-biennial oscillation phase
\cite{pitari2016b} and the season of the year (determining to which hemisphere aerosols
are transported) \cite{toohey2011,toohey2019}. In the case of tropical eruptions,
aerosols are typically transported poleward in the stratosphere and descend back to
mid-latitude troposphere within one to two years \cite{robock2000}. Upon descending
below the tropopause, these aerosols are readily removed by wet deposition
\cite{liu2012}.

Before the current era of significant anthropogenic climate forcing, volcanic eruptions
were the primary forcing mechanism dictating Earth's climate variability during the
Holocene period \cite{sigl2022}. Despite this substantial impact, few climate-model
experiments have included volcanic forcing when simulating climate evolution during the
Holocene \cite{sigl2022}, likely implying an exaggerated positive forcing
\cite{gregory2016,solomon2011}. This absence of persistent cooling is one of several
factors that have been suggested to contribute to the common disparity between simulated
and observed global warming \cite{andersson2015}. Despite extensive attention on
understanding the way volcanic eruptions influence climate, questions regarding aerosol
particle processes---such as growth and creation rates when \ce{OH} is scarce---remain
unanswered \cite<e.g.~>[]{robock2000,zanchettin2019,marshall2020,marshall2022}. These
processes impact aerosol scattering efficiency and potentially the RF to AOD
relationship. \citeA{marshall2020} observe higher aerosol forcing efficiency in
post-eruption years \(2\) and \(3\) compared to year 1, and attribute this post-eruption
increase in aerosol forcing efficiency to strong spatial concentration in the initial
year and subsequent distribution of aerosols over a larger area. This spatial
redistribution increases the albedo per global mean AOD thereby causing a stronger RF to
AOD ratio \cite{marshall2020}.

Previous studies of both Mt.\ Pinatubo \cite{mills2017,hansen2005} and volcanoes within
the instrumental era \cite{gregory2016} have been used to estimate the relationship
between the RF energy imbalance and change in AOD caused by volcanic eruptions. While
\citeA{myhre2013} employ a formula scaling RF by AOD to obtain
\(\SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\), recent literature reports estimates
down to \(\SI{-19.0(5)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) \cite{gregory2016} and
\(\SI{-18.3(10)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) \cite{mills2017}. Synthetic
volcano simulations in \citeA{marshall2020} yield a scaling factor of
\(\SI{-20.5(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) across an ensemble of \(82\)
simulations featuring varying injection heights and latitudes of volcanic emissions,
with \iso{} ranging from \(10\) to \(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

A similar simulation setup, albeit with notable differences, was conducted by
\citeA{niemeier2015}, involving an ensemble of \(14\) levels of injected sulphur
spanning between \(\SI{1}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) and
\(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)). These geoengineering simulations
maintained continuous sulphur injections, running until a steady sulphur level was
achieved. Results indicated an inverse exponential relationship between RF and \iso{}
rate, converging to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) (Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}).
Even the \(100\times\) Mt.\ Pinatubo super-volcano simulation by \citeA{jones2005},
which obtained a peak RF of \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\), is below the suggested limit
of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\). Moreover, \citeA{timmreck2010} find a peak RF anomaly
of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) from a \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) eruption
simulation, which corresponds well with the function estimated by \citeA{niemeier2015}
at the given \ce{SO2} level. Several studies have demonstrated a linear relationship of
approximately \(-\SI{20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) between RF and AOD,
although substantial variability exists in the slope among studies
\cite{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Moreover, a
time-after-eruption dependence on the RF to AOD ratio is found in \citeA{marshall2020},
whereas \citeA{niemeier2015} revealed a non-linear relationship between RF and \iso{}
rate. Thus, a consensus on the relationship between \iso{}, AOD, and RF has yet to be
established.

One avenue that has garnered considerable attention is comparing the magnitude of
volcanic or volcano-like forcings to increased \ce{CO2} levels. Several studies explore
the connection between volcanic forcing and the climate sensitivity to a doubling of
\ce{CO2}
\cite{boer2007,marvel2016,merlis2014,ollila2016,richardson2019,salvi2022,wigley2005}.
The comparison of forcing from volcanoes and \ce{CO2} aims to mitigate the large
uncertainty in estimates of the sensitivity of the real climate system. Inferring
climate sensitivity from volcanic eruption events has been attempted as a way to
constrain the sensitivity \cite{boer2007} by assuming that volcanic and \ce{CO2}
forcings produce similar feedbacks \cite{pauling2023}. Earlier studies suggest the
potential for constraining equilibrium cilmate sensitivity (ECS) using volcanoes
\cite{bender2010}, provided that ECS is constrained by effective radiative forcing (ERF)
rather than instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF), as ERF accounts for rapid atmospheric
adjustments in contrast to IRF \cite{richardson2019}. However, other studies refute this
approach, pointing out that different sensitivities of volcanic forcing and \ce{CO2}
doubling seem to exist \cite{douglass2006}, or that constraining the ECS by ERF lacks
accuracy due to the precision of climate simulations \cite{boer2007,salvi2022}. Although
ERF offers a more suitable indicator of forcing than IRF
\cite{marvel2016,richardson2019}, more recent studies conclude that ECS cannot be
constrained from volcanic eruption events \cite{pauling2023}.

Employing eruptions in the medium to super-volcano size enhances the signal-to-noise
ratio without necessitating an extensive and computationally expensive ensemble, and as
such, is a tempting way to mimic a large ensemble of smaller volcanic eruptions.
However, the AOD, RF, and temperature signatures are not necessarily a simple scaling of
that of smaller volcanic eruptions. Previous studies have simulated super-volcanoes
using AOD as the input forcing, where the AOD was that of Mt.\ Pinatubo scaled by a
factor of one hundred \cite{jones2005}. This approach may yield incorrect results, both
because the peak of the AOD may be too small or too big, but also because the evolution
of the AOD could be inappropriate. Likewise, a different AOD evolution may be found from
similar size eruptions, but at different latitudes. To investigate this issue, our
simulations are based on four levels of \iso{} covering three orders of magnitude and
the inclusion of one high latitude eruption of the second largest \iso{} case.

We conducted ensemble simulations of volcanic eruptions in the CESM2 coupled with the
WACCM6. The ensembles span four different levels of \iso{}:
\(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\),
\(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) and \(\SI{3000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\). Details
regarding the experimental setup are provided in section~\ref{sec:method}. Our findings
reveal non-linear RF to AOD dependencies for medium to super-volcano size eruptions.
Additionally, we observe a time-dependent variation in the RF to AOD ratio, detailed in
section~\ref{sec:results} and discussed in section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Furthermore,
our data, along with insights from previous studies, suggest that the RF dependency on
\iso{} identified by \citeA{niemeier2015} acts as a lower boundary. Our conclusions are
presented in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Model}

We use the CESM2 \cite{danabasoglu2020} in conjunction with the WACCM6
\cite{gettleman2019} and the fully dynamical ocean component Parallel Ocean Program
version 2 (POP2) \cite{smith2010, danabasoglu2020}. The atmosphere model was run at a
nominal \(\SI{2}{\degree}\) resolution with \(70\) vertical levels in the middle
atmosphere (MA) configuration.

The WACCM6 version employed in the MA configuration uses the three mode version of the
Modal Aerosol Module (MAM3) \cite{gettleman2019}, a simplified and computationally
efficient default setting within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5)
\cite{liu2016}, as described in \citeA{liu2012}. The MAM3 was developed from MAM7 and
features the modes Aitken, accumulation, and coarse \cite{liu2016}.

\subsection{Simulations}

Appendix A provides a description of the simulation setup and utilised output variables.
Table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} summarises the simulations, encompassing four
\ce{SO2} injection magnitudes and up to four seasons: 15 February, 15 May, 15 August,
and 15 November. The magnitudes vary over three orders of magnitude:
\(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\),
\(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), and \(\SI{3000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

The smallest eruption case, \cwm{}, is similar in magnitude as compared to events like
Mt.\ Pinatubo \cite<\(\sim10\)--\(\SI{20}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{timmreck2018} and
Mt.\ Tambora \cite<\(\sim\SI{56.2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{zanchettin2016}. The
intermediate case, \cwmp{}, resembles the magnitude of the Samalas eruption in 1257
\cite<\(\sim{144}\)--\(\SI{170}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{vidal2016}, while the second
largest and largest eruption cases, \cws{} and \cwss{}, is in the likely range of the
Young Toba Tuff (YTT) eruption occurring about \(\SI{72000}{\mathrm{yr}}\) ago
\cite<\(100\)--\(\SI{10000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{jones2005}. All eruptions were
situated at the equator (\(\SI{0}{\degree N}\), \(\SI{1}{\degree E}\)) with \ce{SO2}
injected between \(\SI{18}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{20}{\kilo\meter}\) altitude.
Collectively, the four tropical eruption cases \cwm{}, \cwmp{}, \cws{}, and \cwss{} are
referred to as \cwt{}. An additional high-latitude eruption ensemble, labelled \cwsn{},
of the same \iso{} magnitude as \cws{} was simulated at \(\SI{56}{\degree N}\),
\(\SI{287.7}{\degree E}\) with a six-month separation (15 February and 15 August).

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

% NOTE: the results should be laid out in a logical way, with the most
% interesting/important stuff first, then tangents that dig deeper at specific things
% later.
% 1. RF to AOD time-after-eruption dependence should be top priority (8 figs atm.)
% 2. Then probably temperature scaling since we discuss the shape of both AOD and RF
%    time series before that (MOTIVATION: can we expect a specific temperature time
%    series shape based on the shape of either of or both of the RF and AOD time
%    series?)
% 3. If there is something interesting to say about the rest of the figures (all the
%    comparing of parameters), then this should come here.

\subsection{Analysis of the time series}

Figure~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} presents time series of global mean AOD, RF, and
surface air temperature. The black lines represent the medians across the ensembles,
while shading indicates the 5th to 95th percentiles. The four distinct forcing
magnitudes (\cwm{}, \cwmp{}, \cws{}, and \cwss{}) outlined in
table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} have been used. The time series in
Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} are normalised by setting the peak value to unity,
defined based on the peak of a fit from a Savitzky-Golay filter of 3rd order and a
one-year window length \cite{savitzky1964}.

A notable feature across the subfigures of Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} is the peak
occurrence of the \cwm{} case compared to the larger eruption cases. The peak of \cwm{}
arrives earlier for both AOD (Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a) and temperature
(Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}c), while the RF time series in
Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}b are all indistinguishable. Cases \cwmp{}, \cws{}, and
\cwss{} are indistinguishable in their temperature development, and while \cwm{} peaks
at an earlier time, it decays similarly to the other cases. Interestingly, the same
development between \cwmp{} and \cws{} is not found in the AOD time series. \cwm{} peaks
at an earlier time, but also spends more time around the peak and as such decays at a
later time post-eruption. Likewise, \cwmp{} has a faster rise and slower decay compared
to \cws{}, but where both peak at a similar time. \cws{} and \cwss{} have similar AOD
developments, but where \cwss{} show a slightly faster decay from the peak.

The timescale of the perturbation of AOD and RF is shorter than that of the temperature.
While the AOD and RF time series return to their equilibrium state within roughly three
years, the temperature time series remain heavily perturbed three years post-eruption.
Even when running the simulations for 20 years post-eruption, the temperature time
series are still decaying.

\subsection{RF dependency on AOD}

We next focus on the development of the AOD and RF time series relative to each other.
Similar comparisons were conducted in \citeA<>[their Fig.\ 4]{gregory2016} and
\citeA<>[their Fig.\ 1]{marshall2020}, with RF plotted against AOD.
Figure~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} displays annual mean values from the five simulation
cases in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}; the small eruption case (\cwm{}) as blue
downward-pointing triangles, the intermediate eruption case (\cwmp{}) as orange thick
diamonds, the large tropical eruption case (\cws{}) as green upward-pointing triangles,
the extra large eruption case (\cwss{}) as small pink upward-pointing carets, and the
large northern hemisphere eruption case (\cwsn{}) as brown upward-pointing
three-branched twigs. Also shown are the data from \citeA<>[Fig.\ 4, black crosses from
  HadCM3 sstPiHistVol]{gregory2016} as grey crosses labelled G16 (described in Appendix B,
section~\ref{ap:g16}). Additionally, the estimated peak values from the Mt.\ Pinatubo
and Mt.\ Tambora eruptions are plotted as a black star and plus, while the peak from the
\citeA{jones2005} simulation is shown as a pink square labelled J05. Finally, red
circles represent the peak values obtained from the \cwt{} eruption cases. The straight
lines are the same as shown by \citeA{gregory2016}. The full data range is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}a while Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}b highlights a
narrow range, focusing on the \cwm{} case.

The annual mean data from the Pinatubo-like \cwm{} case in
Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}b have RF values as a function of AOD that follow
almost the same constant slope as the G16 data. However, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}a we observe that the stronger eruptions lead to
dissimilar responses in AOD and RF, where \cwmp{} seems to follow close to a \(-10\)
slope and \cws{} is closer to a \(-5\) slope. The peak values (red circles) suggest a
non-linear dependence, while within each eruption strength (same colour) the annual mean
values fall relatively close to a straight line.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/figure2.png}

  \caption{RF as a function of AOD, yearly means. Data from the five simulations listed in
    table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} (\cwm{}, \cwmp{}, \cws{}, \cwsn{}, and \cwss{}) are
    shown along with the data from the HadCM3 sstPiHistVol simulation by \citeA{gregory2016}
    (grey crosses, G16). Also shown are the estimated peak values of the Mt.\ Pinatubo
    (black star) and Mt.\ Tambora (black plus) eruptions. The peak values from the \cw{}
    simulations are shown as red circles. Additionally in (a) the simulated super-volcano of
    \citeA{jones2005} (pink square) is shown. All peak values (as opposed to annual means)

    fits as in \citeA<>[Fig.\ 4]{gregory2016}, where the solid line is the fit to G16. (b):
    Zooming in on the smallest AOD values.}\label{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}%
\end{figure}

To investigate the time dependence of the ratio between RF and AOD, we present seasonal
means of this ratio in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}. The plot shows the eruption
cases given in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}, as well as the tropical eruptions
from \citeA{marshall2020dataset} (\(6\) of \(82\) eruptions), labelled M20 and described
in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:m20}. The \cws{} case is similar to \cwss{} as indicated
in table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}, but is not shown in the plot to better highlight
\cwsn{}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}a, lines are linear regression fits to the
seasonal means across all ensemble members, summarised in
table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Shaded regions are the standard deviation around the
seasonal means. A similar shading is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b, but
where the regression fits have been omitted for clarity. As the AOD and RF time series
start from zero, the ratio from the first season is not included. Likewise, after three
years both time series are almost fully equilibrated
(Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a,b). The data is further divided into two periods; a
pre-peak period where the peak of both the AOD and the RF is included (consisting of the
first post-eruption year), and a post-peak period for the decaying part (consisting of
the second and third post-eruption years).

Although the ratio changes across the eruption magnitudes, we find that all the tropical
cases follow a positive slope during the pre-peak period, as seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}a and described in table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. The
northern latitude case in \cwsn{c2wsn} shows a much flatter slope compared to \cwt{} and
M20. The distinction between the slopes from the tropical and non-tropical cases is
perhaps more clear in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b and corresponding rows in
table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Again, \cwsn{} shows an almost flat slope compared to
the tropical cases. During the second period, more noise is introduced, but a weak
tendency of negative slopes is found among the tropical cases, as well as in the \cwsn{}
case up to the last season where the noise is also the largest.

\citeA<>[their Fig.\ 1c,d]{marshall2020} present results that demonstrate a
time-dependent relationship in the conversion between AOD and RF. They obtain an RF to
AOD ratio with a negative slope when comparing the first post-eruption year to the
second and third. As such, \citeA{marshall2020} find that, on average, the aerosol
forcing efficiency increases during the first two to three post-eruption years. This
phenomenon is explained by \citeA{marshall2020} as the aerosols initially being
spatially confined to the hemisphere where the eruption occurred. Subsequently, during
the second and third years, they spread globally, resulting in a higher global-mean
albedo per AOD and consequently a stronger RF per AOD ratio with time. However, as noted
above, a decrease in aerosol forcing efficiency is found when analysing the M20 data
with seasonal resolution during the pre-peak period (first year post-eruption) while
constraining the ensemble to only include eruptions within \(-10\) to
\(\SI{10}{\degree\mathrm{N}}\). The post-peak period shows an increasing aerosol forcing
efficiency, and during the full first three post-eruption years (pre-peak and
post-peak), both the tropical subset and the full M20 data yield an increasing
efficiency. Likewise, the first three post-eruption years of the \cwmp{}, \cwss{}, and
\cwsn{} cases show a weak negative slope and thus an increasing efficiency, while \cwm{}
shows an elevated post-peak ratio as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b.

We also note that while the aerosol forcing efficiency is decreasing for tropical M20
data in the pre-peak period, the full dataset shows increasing efficiency. This is in
line with what we find from \cwsn{}, which is the only eruption case that does not show
a clear aerosol forcing efficiency decrease during the pre-peak period.

\subsection{Parameter scan}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, we compare the peak values of all investigated CESM2
output parameters against each other as well as to \iso{}. For our tropical cases
(\cwt{}), we observe in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a an almost linear yet notably
weakening relationship between AOD peak values and \iso{}. The latitude also plays a
role in the magnitude of the AOD perturbation, evident from \cwsn{}. This weak yet
notable latitude dependence aligns with findings by \citeA{marshall2019}, indicating
that \(\SI{72}{\percent}\) of the AOD variance can be attributed to \iso{}, while
latitude accounts for only \(\SI{16}{\percent}\) of the variance. Peak values from their
data (82 simulations) plotted as red thin diamonds display a similar pattern, with AOD
exhibiting close to linear dependence on \iso{}, but with latitude introducing a spread
in AOD. Peak values from Mt.\ Pinatubo (P) and Mt.\ Tambora (T) are shown for reference,
along with peak values from \citeA{jones2005} labelled J05 and \citeA{timmreck2010}
labelled T10. The J05 is a simulation of a super-volcano based on a \(100\) times
scaling of the AOD from Mt.\ Pinatubo, while T10 is a simulation of the YTT eruption
based on \ce{SO2} injections.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b, RF plotted against \iso{} (with the absolute value
of RF on the \(y\)-axis) indicates a substantial damping effect on RF as \iso{}
increases for the \cw{} data, in agreement with results from \citeA{ottobliesner2016},
labelled OB16. The OB16 data come from a \(2500\) year long simulation using historic
volcanoes as the only external forcing. The analysis details of OB16 can be found in
Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:ob16}. Despite the model complexity difference,
\citeA{ottobliesner2016}'s simulations using Community Earth System Model version 1
(CESM1) with a low-top atmosphere (CAM5) produce RFs comparable to our findings.

% INFO: the conversion between S and SO2 is confirmed by Niemeier and Timmreck (2015)'s
% reference to the Bekki et al. (1996) paper. Bekki uses 6000 Mt SO2, Niemeier uses 3000
% Tg(S).
\citeA{niemeier2015} conducted simulations of continuous sulphur injections up to
\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\) in the ECHAM5's middle atmosphere
version \cite{giorgetta2006} with aerosol microphysics from HAM \cite{stier2005}. They
observed an RF dependence on \ce{SO2} injection rate following an inverse exponential,
which converges to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\), depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b as the stippled pink line labelled N15 and given as;

\begin{equation}
  \Delta
  R_{\mathrm{TOA}} =
  -\SI{65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}
  \mathrm{e}^{-{\left(\frac{\SI{2246}{\tera\gram(S)yr^{-1}}}{x}\right)}^{0.23}}.
  \label{eq:niemeier_exponential}
\end{equation}
%
Both our simulations and OB16 exhibit a notably faster increase than this exponential
relationship. The results by N15, on which Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} is based,
are all averages over at least three years of steady sulphur burdens, substantially
longer than the time it takes for RF to reach peak values after an eruption. Combined
with their lack of a full chemistry model, a direct comparison between
Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} to peak RF values (occurring about one year
post-eruption) may not reflect the same chemical and physical processes. In
Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}, \(x\) represents \ce{S}, while the axis shows values
of \ce{SO2}, thus halving of the \ce{SO2} values on the axis gives the appropriate shape
of Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} as a function of \ce{S}.

With these caveats in mind, we observe that T10's results closely align with the
function described in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Starting with an initial input
of \(\SI{850}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})}\) (equivalent to \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\),
representing the YTT eruption), their estimated AOD led to a peak RF of
\(\SI{-18}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\), depicted as a pink filled circle in
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b. The results from T10 came from a simulation using the
MPI-ESM climate model, driven by AOD data from the HAM aerosol model. This alignment
likely stems from the utilization of the same aerosol microphysical model in both
\citeA{timmreck2010} and \citeA{niemeier2015}, as well as the application of similar
climate models, MPI-ESM and ECHAM5, respectively. The relationship between climate model
families and their implications are further discussed in Appendix C. Notably, the peak
values from M20 fit well within an upper boundary defined by \cwt{} and OB16, and a
lower boundary defined by Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Eruptions closer to the
equator within M20 align with data points near the upper boundary, whereas eruptions at
more extreme latitudes tend to yield weaker peak RF values, closer to the lower
boundary. Importantly, none of the eruption simulations exceeded the upper threshold of
\(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\) as suggested in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.

Figure~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}c illustrates the response of temperature against
\iso{}. The increase in temperature response with \iso{} decreases for higher \iso{},
showing a similar relationship between \cwt{}, \cwsn{}, and OB16. Notably, T10 and J05
exhibit respectively much weaker and much stronger temperature responses to \iso{} than
\cwt{}. T10 has a maximum temperature anomaly of only \(\SI{-3.5}{\kelvin}\) for their
\(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) eruption, while J05 records a substantially larger
maximum temperature anomaly of \(\SI{-10.7}{\kelvin}\). Since the M20 experiment was
conducted with prescribed sea-surface temperatures \cite{marshall2020}, preventing the
temperature from being fully perturbed, we do not focus on the M20 data in the
temperature plots but include them for completeness.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d, we revisit the relationship between RF and AOD,
focusing on peak values rather than annual and seasonal averages. As previously
discussed, the RF to AOD ratio displays weaker slopes than previous studies, with the
\cw{} peak values not conforming to a linear trend. The relationship between RF and AOD
suggests potential substantial dependencies on the model and its input parameters, such
as latitude, but most notably to an inherent non-linear RF dependence on AOD. Both the
G16 data in Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} and the J05 data originate from the same
climate model. Similarly to what we find from the \cw{} data, the ratio is much stronger
for small eruptions in the industrial era (G16) compared to the super-volcano eruption
(J05).

In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e, we again find that the response of the \cwt{} data
decreases with \iso{}, this time in temperature anomaly. Additionally, both the \cwsn{}
and the J05 cases align well with \cwt{}, with the T10 case following a similar
dependence.

Finally, in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}f, we compare the temperature and RF
responses. Both \cwt{} and OB16 show a near-linear relationship between temperature and
RF. The \cwt{} data indicate a steeper slope, implying stronger temperature
perturbations as compared to OB16. However, potential biases exist in the values from
the analysis of OB16, as outlined in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:ob16}. This, along with
considerable noise, results in the analysis of OB16 temperature anomalies being less
reliable. As in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e, the \cwsn{} case along with both the
T10 and J05 cases closely follow the temperature to RF dependence of \cwt{}.

The almost linear relationship between AOD and \iso{} for the \cwt{} data in
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a suggests a comparable trend for RF versus \iso{} in
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b, as seen for RF versus AOD in
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d. For the same reason, we expect
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e to show a similar pattern for \cwt{} as observed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}c.

This relationship, along with the functional relationships between all other parameters
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, are illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:5_diagram_of_function_relations}. There, we show that from assuming a
linear dependency of AOD on \iso{} (\(ax+b\)), and of temperature on RF (\(cx+d\)), we
must have that \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), and \(k\) all have the same functional form, where
\(f: \ce{SO2} \to \mathrm{RF}\), \(g: \mathrm{AOD} \to \mathrm{T}\), \(h: \ce{SO2} \to
\mathrm{T}\), and \(k: \mathrm{AOD} \to \mathrm{RF}\). From this, we deduce that
\(f(x)=k(ax+b)\) and \(h(x)=f(cx+d)=g(ax+b)\), and finally that \(h(x)=k(acx+ad+b)\),
concluding that \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), and \(k\) have the same functional form.

\subsection{Climate sensitivity estimate}

As previously mentioned, the J05 experiment is similar to \cws{} concerning RF values,
yet differ in both AOD and temperature. At the same time J05 is similar to \cwss{} in
AOD and RF. To investigate this discrepancy, we here conduct a comparison between the
J05 climate feedback parameter \(\alpha\) (where \(s=1/\alpha\) is the climate
sensitivity parameter) with our climate resistance, denoted as \(\rho\), and the
transient climate response parameter (TCRP) \(1/\rho\) (where
\(\mathrm{TCS}=F_{2\times\ce{CO2}}\times \mathrm{TCRP}\) is the transient climate
sensitivity and \(F_{2\times\ce{CO2}}\) is the forcing due to a doubling of
pre-industrial \ce{CO2} concentration). As the forcing of volcanic eruptions typically
lasts for about a year, a duration too short for \(F=\rho T\) to remain valid, an
alternative approach using a time-integral form introduced by \citeA{merlis2014} is
applied:

\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t=\rho\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t
  \label{eq:climate-resistance-orig}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \rho=\frac{\int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t}{\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t}.
  \label{eq:climate-resistance}
\end{equation}

If the upper bound of the integral, \(\tau\), is sufficiently large, so that the upper
ocean heat content is the same at \(t=0\) and \(t=\tau\) (\citeA{merlis2014} used \(\tau
=\SI{15}{\mathrm{yr}}\)), this approach agrees with \(F=\rho T\) for long-term forcing
\cite{gregory2016}. Additionally, we note that the climate resistance and the climate
feedback parameter are associated with the ocean heat uptake efficiency (\(\kappa\))
through \(\rho =\alpha +\kappa\) \cite{gregory2016}.

The climate feedback parameter estimated by \citeA{jones2005} is \(\alpha \simeq
\SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), exceeding twice the value obtained by
\citeA{gregory2016} in their simulations of Mt.\ Pinatubo using the same HadCM3 climate
model. We determine the climate resistance using the integral-form computation outlined
in Eq.~\ref{eq:climate-resistance} and adopting \(\tau =\SI{20}{\mathrm{yr}}\). The
estimated climate resistance from the three tropical simulation cases (with four in each
ensemble) converges to \(\rho =\SI{2.5(4)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), and TCRP
values of \(1/\rho=\SI{0.41(5)}{\kelvin\watt^{-1}\metre^{2}}\), as reported in
table~\ref{tab:trcp}, and is therefore assumed to be a good estimate of \(\alpha\).

Importantly, our estimate agrees well with G16, while the J05 estimate of \(\alpha
\simeq \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\) is still notably higher. Since the
temperature perturbation obtained by J05 was larger than in any of our CESM2 cases, it
indicates that the forcing used by J05 must be stronger. The peak value of the J05 RF is
similar to the \cws{} case, and as such, the overall stronger forcing must originate
from the development of the forcing time series rather than the peak value.

% RF / AOD linearity does not hold for large eruptions
Figures~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes},~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}, and
\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d demonstrate that as the AOD exceeds approximately \(1.0\),
the linear RF dependence of approximately
\(\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) no longer holds. The sublinear increase
in RF with \iso{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b for large eruptions is consistent
with previous results from simulations using similar climate models of smaller historic
eruptions (G16) and of super-volcanoes (J05). Such a change in ratio has been attributed
to larger eruptions, injecting more \ce{SO2}, leading to larger aerosols, and hence less
effective radiation scattering, thereby reducing the RF for the same \iso{}
\cite{english2013, timmreck2010, timmreck2018}.

% Latitude is more important for the development of the RF / AOD ratio
The non-linear relationship between peak RF and AOD values is a strong signature in both
Figs.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} and~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}. Across eruptions of
the same strength, the ratio stays relatively constant, leading to a close to
\(\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) slope for \cwmp{} and a
\(\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) slope for \cws{} and \cwss{}. Still, a
non-linear development in the RF to AOD ratio is found, most notably across all tropical
eruptions. Similar to the results of \citeA{marshall2020}, we find in \cwmp{}, \cws{},
and \cwss{} that the post-peak period (second and third post-eruption years) has a
stronger aerosol forcing efficiency compared to the pre-peak period (first post-eruption
year). The post-peak period of \cwm{} is elevated as compared to the pre-peak period,
resulting in a decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency from the first to the second and
third post-eruption years, in contrast to the other tropical eruptions.

Focusing on the pre-peak period, we find tropical eruptions to differ from eruptions at
high latitudes. During the pre-peak period, all tropical eruptions show a decreasing
aerosol forcing efficiency, while no significant change in the RF to AOD ratio is found
from the \cwsn{} case. The full M20 dataset indicates an increasing aerosol forcing
efficiency also during the pre-peak period, contrasting the decreasing efficiency found
from their tropical eruptions and supporting the latitudinal dependence we find in
\cwsn{}. While we find a linear relationship to be a useful approximation of RF
dependence on AOD for eruptions similar to or smaller than Mt.\ Pinatubo, additional
factors must be considered for larger eruptions. These factors, such as \ce{OH} scarcity
and aerosol growth, influence reflectance and their gravitational pull, substantially
impacting both AOD and RF evolution, as highlighted by \citeA{timmreck2010}. The large
difference in ratio found when comparing eruption magnitudes suggests that \iso{} is
crucial when estimating the time-average of the RF to AOD ratio. However, latitude and,
in particular, aerosol dispersion are more influential in determining the post-eruption
evolution of the ratio, particularly during the pre-peak period.

% Models vary in their SO2 to H2SO4 chemistry/physics, but are comparatively consistent in representing AOD, RF and temperature.
The biggest spread in the data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan} is found when
relating \iso{} to any of the three output parameters. As the amount of \iso{}
increases, both AOD, RF, and temperature across models have a big spread. The AOD to
\iso{} relationship is consistent within similar models, even when comparing simulations
of volcanic eruptions \cite{timmreck2010} and continuous injection of \ce{SO2}
\cite{niemeier2015}, but has a wide spread at high values of \iso{} across model
families (Figs.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a,b,c). Comparatively, the RF
(Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d) and temperature (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e) as
a function of AOD, as well as temperature as a function of RF
(Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}f), demonstrate a smaller spread across models.
\citeA{marshall2019, marshall2020, marshall2021} use a code with seven log-normal modes
to simulate aerosol mass and number concentrations, along with an atmosphere-only
configuration of the UM-UKCA with prescribed sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice extent
\cite{marshall2019}. This approach is in contrast with CESM2, operating as an Earth
System Model, but with a simpler aerosol chemistry model in the MAM3. The family of
models to which M20 is based is different from that of \cw{} and OB16, and also
different from the T10 and N15, as described in Appendix C. Based on
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, we find the model family to be pivotal in determining
the estimated AOD and RF magnitudes from \iso{}, whereas the various models generally
demonstrate more consistency in representing RF from AOD. Despite the large spread in
\iso{} and corresponding response in RF, none of the eruption simulations shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan} violated the suggested upper threshold of
\(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) as defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.

% AOD time series are different across eruption magnitudes, and peak at later times
\citeA{timmreck2010} highlights that for sufficiently large eruptions, \ce{OH} radicals
are too scarce, which limits \ce{SO2} oxidation. The AOD peak in the YTT simulation of
T10 occurs six months after Mt.\ Pinatubo's peak. This aligns with our results, as
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a, where \cwm{} shows an earlier AOD
peak compared to \cwmp{}, \cws{}, and \cwss{}. While the peak RF value of T10 occurs
\(7\)--\(8\) months post-eruption, similar to \cw{}, the J05 peak anomaly occurs one
year post-eruption. Additionally, as \citeA{jones2005} obtains a climate feedback
parameter larger than both what \citeA{gregory2016} found for the same climate model and
larger than the climate resistance obtained here from \cw{}, we conclude that such a
simple approach of scaling the AOD of smaller eruptions to represent larger eruptions is
insufficient. Moreover, having a small ensemble of large eruptions to represent smaller
eruptions is also insufficient when simulating from \iso{}, as both AOD and temperature
evolution are found to develop differently.

\section{Summary and conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We consider three medium to super-volcano sized eruptions and compare them to previously
reported results. We find the commonly adopted RF dependence on AOD of
\(\sim\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) to be representative for Mt.\
Pinatubo-sized eruptions. Larger eruptions, with one to two orders of magnitude larger
injections of \ce{SO2}, are found to have an RF dependence on AOD closer to
\(\sim\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) and
\(\sim\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\). A shallower slope for larger
eruptions is also consistent with peak values from previous studies of super-volcanoes.

The time-after-eruption dependence of the ratio between RF and AOD is found to weaken
with time, resulting in a decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency in the pre-peak period.
The effect is found across all eruption sizes, but only the tropical cases show a clear
trend. The high-latitude case displays an almost constant efficiency with time. These
results agree with a reanalysis of the tropical data in \citeA{marshall2020dataset}.
Thus, these findings provide strong supporting evidence that latitude is generally
significant in determining the aerosol forcing efficiency, particularly as a function of
time-after-eruption. These findings emphasise the complexity of volcanic impacts on
climate, demonstrating significant differences in climatic response depending on
eruption magnitude and latitude.

We find that the AOD peak arrives later for larger eruptions than for smaller ones, and
also that larger eruptions produce a sharper peak in the AOD time series. The RF time
series are similar across all eruption sizes, and while the smallest eruption
experiences a faster temperature decay, the larger eruptions produce time series
indistinguishable in development for both RF and temperature. Thus, a simple scaling of
the AOD or temperature time series from a smaller eruption is insufficient in
representing that of larger volcanic eruptions.

Considering \iso{} and the peak values of AOD and RF, a large spread is found across
model families in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}. Improving the consistency between
model families in how the chemistry and physics of \ce{SO2} and \ce{H2SO4} are
represented is an important step in enhancing the accuracy of simulated volcanic
eruptions' influence on climate by models. More simulations of larger volcanic eruptions
with \iso{} greater than \(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\mathrm{SO2})}\) would provide useful
information for a more precise determination of the RF to AOD ratio in the non-linear
regime. This would also serve as a useful test to check if a comparison between \ce{SO2}
injection events and continuous \ce{SO2} injection is reasonable. Introducing a spread
in latitude similar to the \citeA{marshall2020dataset} dataset would allow for better
comparison between eruptions across all latitudes and the suggested lower limit
following Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}, describing a situation of aerosol
saturation.

We find that the suggested upper threshold from Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} is not
violated by any eruption simulation, and most notably that the temperature peak value
follow the RF trend in reaching a limiting value.

\section{Simulation set up and output}

Input files used in the simulations were created by modifying the file available at
\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl},
using a Python package available on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking} or through the Python Package Index
(PyPI). The package is available both as a library and a Command Line Interface (CLI),
and is used to create volcanic eruptions with a specified amount of \ce{SO2} that is
injected over six hours at a given latitude, longitude, and altitude. All volcanic
\ce{SO2} files are created from a shell script by setting the eruption details in a JSON
file that is read by the \texttt{volcano-cooking} CLI at a fixed version, ensuring a
reproducible experiment setup.

We are using the coupled model version \texttt{BWma1850} component setup to run the
CESM2, and an accompanying fixed sea-surface temperature version, \texttt{fSST1850}, to
obtain estimates of the RF. The applied \texttt{fSST1850} is not from a standardised
component setup but is instead explicitly specified.\footnote{\fssturl} The component
setup \texttt{BWma1850} and \texttt{fSST1850} differ in that the latter uses a
prescribed sea-ice (\texttt{CICE -> CICE\%PRES}), a prescribed data ocean
(\texttt{POP2\%ECO\%DEP -> DOCN\%DOM}) and a stub wave component instead of the full
Wave Watch version 3 (\texttt{WW3 -> SWAV}).

The important input data used in the model simulations are \iso{} in units of teragrams
(\(\si{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\)), used to simulate volcanic eruptions. RF is calculated
as the combined (short wave and long wave) all-sky TOA energy imbalance, where the CESM2
provide the output variables ``net solar flux at the top of the model'' (FSNT) and ``net
longwave flux at the top of the model'' (FLNT). Thus, \(\mathrm{RF_*}= \mathrm{FSNT} -
\mathrm{FLNT}\), and taking the difference between volcanic forcing simulations and a
control simulation gives the final estimate of RF
(\(\mathrm{RF}=\mathrm{RF_{VOLC}}-\mathrm{RF_{CONTROL}}\)) \cite{marshall2020}. The RF
calculation is based on \texttt{fSST1850}, hence this outline specifically describes how
to calculate ERF as opposed to IRF, which instead is the difference between the ERF and
the sum of all rapid atmospheric adjustments \cite{marshall2020,smith2018}. The AOD is
obtained from the output variable ``stratospheric aerosol optical depth 550 nm day
nigth'' (AODVISstdn), while global temperature is saved by CESM2 to the variable
``reference height temperature'' (TREFHT). The analysis of this work is performed using
these four variables.

During analysis, one outlier was found in the ensemble representing \cwm{}, specifically
in the temperature time series. This ensemble member was the February 15, 1850,
eruption, which was changed in favor of a February 15, 1851, eruption in the \cwm{},
\cwmp{}, and \cws{} ensembles. For completeness, the February 15, 1850, eruption is
still included in the online archive.

\section{External data}

\subsection{Otto-Bliesner data analysis}\label{ap:ob16}

Data from \citeA{ottobliesner2016} are the original input data of \iso{} as used in
their model simulations, along with RF and temperature output data. The \iso{} can be
downloaded with a direct link from
\url{https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/volc/IVI2LoadingLatHeight501-2000_L18_c20100518.nc},
or found at \url{https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/paleo/simulations/ccsm4-lm}
and \url{https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/volc/}. Only
the peak values of the \ce{SO2} dataset were used in the analysis. Output variables are
available at
\url{https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/dataset/ucar.cgd.cesm2le.atm.proc.daily_ave.html}.

Since the OB16 dataset contains a five-member ensemble, the final RF and temperature
time series used were ensemble means. A single control simulation time series is used to
remove seasonal dependence from the temperature, where the control simulation is
averaged into a climatology mean. Further, a drift in the temperature is removed by
subtracting a linear regression fit. RF has seasonality removed in the Fourier domain.

The time of an eruption is found based on a best attempt at aligning the \ce{SO2} time
series with both the RF time series and the temperature time series. The RF and
temperature peak values are taken as the value of the time series at the time of an
eruption according to the \ce{SO2} time series. Missing the true peak means the found
peaks will be biased towards lower values. However, instances where eruptions occur
close in time will contribute a bias to higher values. These biases contribute to a
greater uncertainty related to OB16 in Figs.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b,c,f.

\subsection{Marshall data analysis}\label{ap:m20}

Data used to compute the M20 values were from \citeA{marshall2020dataset}, available at
\url{https://doi.org/10.5285/232164e8b1444978a41f2acf8bbbfe91}. As each file includes a
single eruption, peak values of AOD, RF, and temperature were found by applying a
Savitzky-Golay filter of third order and one-year window length, and choosing the
maximum value \cite{savitzky1964}.

\subsection{Gregory data analysis}\label{ap:g16}

Data used to compute G16 values were kindly provided by Jonathan Gregory (personal
communication). The full 160-year-long time series were further analysed by computing
annual means.

\section{Model families}

The model used here was the CESM2 with the WACCM6 atmosphere in the MA configuration.
The MA configuration uses the MAM3 \cite{gettleman2019}, a simplified and
computationally efficient default setting within the CAM5 \cite{liu2016}, as described
in \citeA{liu2012}. The MAM3 was developed from MAM7, consisting of the seven modes
Aitken, accumulation, primary carbon, fine dust, fine sea salt, coarse dust, and coarse
sea salt. Instantaneous internal mixing of primary carbonaceous aerosols with secondary
aerosols and instantaneous ageing of primary carbonaceous particles are assumed by
emitting primary carbon in the accumulation mode \cite{liu2016}. As dust absorbs water
efficiently and is expected to be removed by wet deposition similarly to sea salt, fine
dust is merged with fine sea salt into the accumulation mode and coarse dust is merged
with coarse sea salt into a coarse mode. The coarse mode will quickly revert to its
background state below the tropopause \cite{liu2012}. Consequently, MAM3 features the
three modes Aitken, accumulation, and coarse \cite{liu2016}.

The CESM2 is an ancestor of CESM1 used by OB16. They belong to a different model family
than both the HadCM3 (J05 and G16) and the UM-UKCA (M20), which is an extended version
of HadGEM3 \cite{dhomse2014}, and an ancestor of HadCM3. A third model family is
represented through ECHAM5 (N15) and MPI-ESM (T10), where the latter is related to the
former via the ECHAM6. A summary of the model code genealogy is in
table~\ref{tab:model-family}, based on the model code genealogy map created by
\citeA{kuma2023}.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
will not be numbered, e.g.,:
\[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
\begin{equation}
  x^2=y^2 + z^2
\end{equation}

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
  && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
  && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
