  \begin{abstract}
    We investigate the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions spanning from Mt.\
    Pinatubo-sized events to \note[reviewer1]{L11} supereruptions. The study is based on
    ensemble simulations in the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) climate
    model using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6)
    atmosphere model. Our analysis focuses on the impact of different \ce{SO2}-amount
    injections on stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD), \note[reviewer1]{L15}
    effective radiative forcing (ERF), and global mean surface temperature (GMST)
    anomalies. Unlike the traditional linear model used for eruptions up to Mt.\
    Pinatubo-size, a non-linear relationship is typically found between ERF and AOD for
    larger eruptions. We further uncover a notable time-dependent decrease in aerosol
    forcing efficiency (ERF normalised by AOD) across all eruption magnitudes during the
    first post-eruption year. In addition, the study reveals that the largest as
    compared to Pinatubo-sized eruption events produce a delayed and sharper peak in
    AOD, and a longer-lasting GMST response while the time evolution of ERF remains
    similar between the two eruption types. We find that the peak ERF approaches a
    limiting value, and that the peak GMST response follows linearly, effectively
    bounding the GMST to at most \(\sim\SI{-10}{\kelvin}\). When including the results
    of previous studies, we find that relating \ce{SO2} to any other parameter is
    inconsistent across models compared to the relationships between AOD, ERF, and GMST.
    Thus, we expect the largest uncertainty in model codes to relate to
    \note[reviewer1]{L25} the chemistry and physics of aerosol evolution.

  Volcanic eruptions can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate. Eruptions
  large enough that \note[reviewer1]{L31} the aerosols that form from the gases they
  emit reach the stratosphere cause a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight. The gases from volcanic eruptions form aerosols. If the eruption is large enough, these aerosols may reach the stratosphere where they may cause a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight.
  Typically, an eruption is measured by its impact on the opacity of the stratosphere and the
  change in the \note[reviewer1]{L33} energy balance at the top of the atmosphere when
  the surface temperature is held fixed. The two measures are often assumed to be
  linearly related, but the linearity is useful only for eruptions of sizes seen in the
  last two millennia. We use a coupled climate model to simulate the impact of eruptions
  of sizes up to the largest known eruptions. The smallest eruptions we simulate are
  still large enough to cause global climate effects. In addition to the expected non-linear
  relationship between energy imbalance and stratospheric opacity with increasing
  eruption magnitude, our simulations and supporting data shows that the eruption
  latitude significantly influences the development of the relationship with time after
  the eruption. Additionally, we find evidence that the peak energy imbalance reaches a
  limit, and that the peak temperature response follows linearly with the peak energy
  imbalance, also reaching a limiting value.

  Effective radiative forcing (ERF) and stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) are
  crucial metrics representing the energy imbalance at top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) when
  ocean and sea-ice is held fixed and the stratospheric opacity due to aerosol
  scattering, respectively. While calculation and estimation of forcing has not always
  had an agreed-upon methodology, including both instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF)
  describing the radiative forcing at TOA, similar to ERF but where ERF also accounts
  for rapid adjustments, and stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing (RF)
  \cite{forster2016}. Still, ERF and AOD are extensively used to quantify the impact of
  major volcanic eruptions, and a general assumption of a linear dependency of ERF on
  AOD is commonly adopted \cite{myhre2013,andersson2015}. Applying such a linear
  relationship has yielded reasonably accurate estimates in climate model simulations of
  volcanic eruptions \cite{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}.
  Yet, a wide spread in the estimated aerosol forcing efficiencies (ERF normalised by
  AOD) exists among studies, spanning approximately from \(\sim
  \SI{-15}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\) \cite{pitari2016b} to \note[reviewer1]{L55}
  \(\sim \SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\) \cite{hansen2005b}. Additionally,
  these estimates are predominantly based on small eruptions with AOD values up to at
  most \(\sim 0.7\).

  % the peak in AOD (at 500 nm) and thus the ERF depends also on the aerosol size
  % distribution, which evolves on a longer time scale than the conversion of SO2 to
  % aerosol.
  Although \ce{H2O}, \ce{N2}, and \ce{CO2} are the most abundant gases emitted by
  volcanoes \cite{robock2000}, sulphur species such as \ce{SO2} provide a greater
  influence due to the comparatively high background concentrations of the former gases
  in the atmosphere. The transformation of \ce{SO2} molecules through reactions with
  \ce{OH} and \ce{H2O} leads to the formation of sulphuric acid (\ce{H2SO4})
  \cite{pinto1989,zhao1995}, which scatters sunlight thereby elevating planetary albedo
  and reducing the ERF. As the conversion from \ce{SO2} to \ce{H2SO4}
  \note[reviewer1]{L63} occurs over weeks \note[reviewer1]{L63}
  \cite{pinto1989,zhao1995}, the peak \ce{H2SO4} burden experiences a slight delay from
  the eruption's peak \ce{SO2} injection. The lifetime of the \ce{H2SO4} aerosols in the
  stratosphere depends on various factors, including aerosol size
  \cite{rampino1982,pinto1989,marshall2019}, latitude \cite{marshall2019, toohey2019},
  volcanic plume height \cite{marshall2019}, the quasi-biennial oscillation phase
  \cite{pitari2016b} and the season of the year (determining to which hemisphere
  aerosols are transported) \cite{toohey2011,toohey2019}. In the case of tropical
  eruptions, aerosols are typically transported poleward in the stratosphere and descend
  back to mid-latitude troposphere within one to two years \cite{robock2000}. Upon
  descending below the tropopause, these aerosols are readily removed by wet deposition
  \cite{liu2012}.

  \note[reviewer1]{L75} Before the current era of significant anthropogenic climate
  forcing, volcanic eruptions were the primary forcing mechanism dictating Earth's
  climate variability during the Holocene period \cite{schurer2013}. Despite this
  substantial impact, few climate-model experiments have included volcanic forcing when
  simulating climate evolution during the Holocene \cite{sigl2022}, likely implying an
  exaggerated positive forcing \cite{gregory2016,solomon2011}. This absence of
  persistent cooling is one of several factors that have been suggested to contribute to
  the common disparity between simulated and observed global warming
  \cite{andersson2015}. Despite extensive attention on understanding the way volcanic
  eruptions influence climate, questions regarding aerosol particle processes---such as
  growth and creation rates when \ce{OH} is scarce---remain unanswered
  \cite<e.g.~>[]{zanchettin2019,marshall2020,marshall2022,mcgraw2024}. These processes
  impact aerosol scattering efficiency and potentially the ERF to AOD relationship.
  \citeA{marshall2020} observe higher aerosol forcing efficiency in post-eruption years
  \(2\) and \(3\) compared to year 1, and attribute this post-eruption increase in
  aerosol forcing efficiency to strong spatial concentration in the initial year and
  subsequent distribution of aerosols over a larger area. This spatial redistribution
  increases the albedo per global mean AOD thereby causing a stronger ERF to AOD ratio
  \cite{marshall2020}.

  Previous studies of both Mt.\ Pinatubo \cite{mills2017,hansen2005} and volcanoes
  within the instrumental era \cite{gregory2016} have been used to estimate the
  relationship between the ERF energy imbalance and change in AOD. While
  \citeA{myhre2013} employ a formula scaling ERF by AOD to obtain
  \(\SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\), recent literature reports estimates
  down to \note[reviewer1]{L94}{\(\SI{-19.0(5)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\)}
  \note[reviewer1]{L95} \cite{gregory2016} and
  \(\SI{-18.3(10)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) \cite{mills2017}. Synthetic
  volcano simulations in \citeA{marshall2020} yield a scaling factor of
  \(\SI{-20.5(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) across an ensemble of \(82\)
  simulations featuring varying injection heights and latitudes of volcanic emissions,
  with injected \ce{SO2} ranging from \(10\) to \(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

  A similar simulation setup, albeit with notable differences, was conducted by
  \citeA{niemeier2015}, involving an ensemble of \(14\) levels of injected sulphur
  spanning between \(\SI{1}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
  (\(\SI{2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) and
  \(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
  (\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)). These geoengineering simulations
  maintained continuous sulphur injections, running until a steady sulphur level was
  achieved. Results indicated an inverse exponential relationship between maximum
  forcing and \note[reviewer1]{L104} annually injected \ce{SO2}, converging to
  \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) (Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}). Even the
  \(100\times\) Mt.\ Pinatubo supereruption simulation by \citeA{jones2005}, which
  obtained a peak ERF of \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\), is below the suggested limit of
  \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\). \note[reviewer1]{L107} Moreover, \citeA{timmreck2010}
  find a peak ERF anomaly of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) from a
  \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) eruption simulation, which corresponds well with
  the function estimated by \citeA{niemeier2015} at an annual injecting rate of
  \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\mathrm{SO_2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\). Several studies have
  demonstrated a linear relationship of approximately
  \(-\SI{20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) between ERF and AOD, although
  substantial variability exists in the slope among studies
  \cite{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Moreover, a
  time-after-eruption dependence on the ERF to AOD ratio is found in
  \citeA{marshall2020}, whereas \citeA{niemeier2015} revealed a non-linear relationship
  between ERF and injected \ce{SO2} rate. Thus, a consensus on the relationship between
  injected \ce{SO2}, AOD, and ERF has yet to be established.

  One avenue that has garnered considerable attention is comparing the magnitude of
  volcanic or volcano-like forcings to increased \ce{CO2} levels. Several studies
  explore the connection between volcanic forcing and the climate sensitivity to a
  doubling of \ce{CO2}
  \cite{boer2007,marvel2016,merlis2014,ollila2016,richardson2019,salvi2022,wigley2005}.
  The comparison of forcing from volcanoes and \ce{CO2} aims to mitigate the large
  uncertainty in estimates of the sensitivity of the real climate system. Inferring
  climate sensitivity from volcanic eruption events has been attempted as a way to
  constrain the sensitivity \cite{boer2007} by assuming that volcanic and \ce{CO2}
  forcings produce similar feedbacks \cite{pauling2023}. Earlier studies suggest the
  potential for constraining equilibrium cilmate sensitivity (ECS) using volcanoes
  \cite{bender2010}, provided that ECS is constrained by effective radiative forcing
  (ERF) rather than instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF), as ERF accounts for rapid
  atmospheric adjustments in contrast to IRF
  \cite{smith2018,richardson2019,marshall2020}. However, other studies refute this
  approach, pointing out that different sensitivities of volcanic forcing and \ce{CO2}
  doubling seem to exist \cite{douglass2006}, or that constraining the ECS by ERF lacks
  accuracy due to the precision of climate simulations \cite{boer2007,salvi2022}.
  Although ERF offers a more suitable indicator of forcing than IRF
  \cite{marvel2016,richardson2019}, more recent studies conclude that ECS cannot be
  constrained from volcanic eruption events \cite{pauling2023}.

  \note[reviewer1]{L135} Employing eruptions in the large to supereruption size enhances
  the signal-to-noise ratio without necessitating an extensive and computationally
  expensive ensemble, and as such, is a tempting shortcut to try and mimic a large
  ensemble of smaller volcanic eruptions. However, the AOD, ERF, and GMST signatures are
  not necessarily a simple scaling of that of smaller volcanic eruptions. Previous
  studies have simulated supereruptions using AOD as the input forcing, where the AOD
  was that of Mt.\ Pinatubo scaled by a factor of one hundred \cite{jones2005}. More
  recent studies find this approach will yield incorrect results, both because the peak
  of the AOD is likely to be too big, but also because the evolution of the AOD could be
  inappropriate due to the aerosol size \cite{timmreck2009,timmreck2010}. Likewise, a
  different AOD evolution may be found from similar size eruptions, but at different
  latitudes \cite{schneider2009,marshall2020,zhuo2024}. To investigate this issue, our
  simulations are based on four levels of injected \ce{SO2} covering three orders of
  magnitude and the inclusion of one high latitude eruption of the second largest
  injected \ce{SO2} case.

  We conducted ensemble simulations of volcanic eruptions in the Community Earth System
  Model Version 2 (CESM2) coupled with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
  Version 6 (WACCM6). The ensembles span four different levels of injected \ce{SO2}:
  \(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\),
  \(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) and \(\SI{3000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\). Details
  regarding the experimental setup are provided in section~\ref{sec:method}. Our
  findings reveal non-linear ERF to AOD dependencies for large to super-volcano size
  eruptions. Additionally, we observe a time-dependent variation in the ERF to AOD
  ratio, detailed in section~\ref{sec:results} and discussed in
  section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Furthermore, our data, along with insights from previous
  studies, suggest that the ERF dependency on injected \ce{SO2} identified by
  \citeA{niemeier2015} acts as a lower boundary. Our conclusions are presented in
  section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

  \section{Method}

  \label{sec:method}

  \subsection{Model}

  We use the CESM2 \cite{danabasoglu2020} in conjunction with the WACCM6
  \cite{gettleman2019} and the fully dynamical ocean component Parallel Ocean Program
  version 2 (POP2) \cite{smith2010, danabasoglu2020}. The atmosphere model was run at a
  nominal \(\SI{2}{\degree}\) resolution with \(70\) vertical levels in the middle
  atmosphere (MA) configuration.

  The WACCM6 version employed in the MA configuration uses the three mode version of the
  Modal Aerosol Module (MAM3) \cite{gettleman2019}, a simplified and computationally
  efficient default setting within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5)
  \cite{liu2016}, as described in \citeA{liu2012}. The MAM3 was developed from MAM7 and
  features the modes Aitken, accumulation, and coarse \cite{liu2016}, and further
  updated to simulate stratospheric sulfate aerosol from volcanic and non-volcanic
  emissions \cite{mills2016}.

  \subsection{Simulations}

  \note[reviewer1]{L157}

  We are using the coupled model version BWma1850 component setup to run the CESM2 with
  a fully dynamic ocean component to get estimates of the GMST, and an accompanying
  fixed sea-surface temperature version, fSST1850, providing estimates of the ERF and
  AOD. The applied fSST1850 is not from a standardised component setup of CESM2 but is
  instead explicitly specified as \url{1850_CAM60
    %WCCM_CLM50%BGC-CROP_CICE%PRES_DOCN%DOM_MOSART_CISM2%NOEVOLVE_SWAV_TEST
    %
  }. % Necessary to make the formatter not break the URL / literal text
  The component setup BWma1850 and fSST1850 differ in that the latter uses a prescribed
  sea-ice (\texttt{CICE -> CICE\%PRES}), a prescribed data ocean (\texttt{POP2\%ECO\%DEP
    -> DOCN\%DOM}) and a stub wave component instead of the full Wave Watch version 3
  (\texttt{WW3 -> SWAV}).

  The important input data used in the model simulations are injected \ce{SO2} in units
  of teragrams (\(\si{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\)), used to simulate volcanic eruptions. ERF
  is calculated as the combined (short wave and long wave) all-sky TOA energy imbalance,
  where the CESM2 provide the output variables ``net solar flux at the top of the
  model'' (FSNT) and ``net longwave flux at the top of the model'' (FLNT). Thus,
  \(\mathrm{ERF_*}= \mathrm{FSNT} - \mathrm{FLNT}\), and taking the difference between
  volcanic forcing simulations and a control simulation gives the final estimate of ERF
  (\(\mathrm{ERF}=\mathrm{ERF_{VOLC}}-\mathrm{ERF_{CONTROL}}\)) \cite{marshall2020}. The
  ERF calculation uses the fSST1850 component setup, which is also used to obtain all
  other simulation output fields except from GMST which uses BWma1850. The AOD is
  obtained from the output variable ``stratospheric aerosol optical depth 550 nm day
  night'' (AODVISstdn), while GMST is saved by CESM2 to the variable ``reference height
  temperature'' (TREFHT). The analysis of this work is performed using these four
  variables.

  Appendix A provides a description of the simulation setup.
  Table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} summarises the simulations, encompassing four
  \ce{SO2} injection magnitudes and up to four seasons: 15 February, 15 May, 15 August,
  and 15 November. \note[reviewer2]{MC2} The magnitudes vary over three orders of
  magnitude, or as introduced in \citeA{schmidt2022} across volcano-climate index values
  \(3\) to \(6\): \(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\),
  \(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), and \(\SI{3000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

  The smallest eruption case, S26, is similar in magnitude as compared to events like
  Mt.\ Pinatubo \cite<\(\sim10\)--\(\SI{20}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{timmreck2018}
  and Mt.\ Tambora \cite<\(\sim\SI{56.2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{zanchettin2016}.
  \note[reviewer1]{L178} The intermediate case, S400, resembles the magnitude of the
  Samalas eruption in 1257
  \cite<\(\sim{144}\)--\(\SI{170}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{vidal2016} however
  injecting about twice of the estimated \ce{SO2}, while the second largest and largest
  eruption cases, S1629 and S3000, is in the likely range of the Young Toba Tuff (YTT)
  supereruption occurring about \(\SI{72000}{\mathrm{yr}}\) ago
  \cite<\(100\)--\(\SI{10000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);>[]{jones2005}. All eruptions were
  situated at the equator (\(\SI{0}{\degree N}\), \(\SI{1}{\degree E}\)) with \ce{SO2}
  \note[reviewer1]{L182} injected from \(\SI{18}{\kilo\meter}\) to
  \(\SI{20}{\kilo\meter}\) altitude with a linear ramp; 25\% between
  \(\SI{17.5}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{18.5}{\kilo\meter}\), 50\% between
  \(\SI{18.5}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{19.5}{\kilo\meter}\), and the last 25\% between
  \(\SI{19.5}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{20.5}{\kilo\meter}\). Collectively, the four
  tropical eruption cases S26, S400, S1629, and S3000 are referred to as STrop. An
  additional high-latitude eruption ensemble, labelled S1629N, of the same injected
  \ce{SO2} magnitude as S1629 was simulated at \(\SI{56}{\degree N}\),
  \(\SI{287.7}{\degree E}\) with a six-month separation (15 February and 15 August)
  between the two simulations.

  \subsection{Analysis of the time series}

  Figure~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} presents time series of global mean AOD, ERF, and
  GMST. The black lines represent the medians across the ensembles, while shading
  indicates the 5th to 95th percentiles. The four distinct forcing magnitudes (S26,
  S400, S1629, and S3000) outlined in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} have been
  used. The time series in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} are normalised by setting
  the peak value to unity, defined based on the peak of a fit from a Savitzky-Golay
  filter of 3rd order and a one-year window length \cite{savitzky1964}.

  A notable feature across the subfigures of Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} is the
  peak occurrence of the S26 case compared to the larger eruption cases. The peak of S26
  arrives earlier for both AOD (Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a) and GMST
  (Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}c), \note[reviewer1]{L197} while the normalised ERF
  time series in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}b are all indistinguishable. Cases
  S400, S1629, and S3000 are indistinguishable in their GMST development, and while S26
  peaks at an earlier time, it decays similarly to the other cases. Interestingly, the
  same development between S400 and S1629 is not found in the AOD time series. S26 peaks
  at an earlier time, but also spends more time around the peak and as such decays at a
  later time post-eruption. Likewise, S400 has a faster rise and slower decay compared
  to S1629, but where both peak at a similar time. S1629 and S3000 have
  \note[reviewer1]{L204} similar normalised AOD developments, but where S3000 show a
  slightly faster decay from the peak.

  The timescale of the perturbation of AOD and ERF is shorter than that of the GMST.
  While the AOD and ERF time series return to their equilibrium state within roughly
  three years, the GMST time series remain heavily perturbed three years post-eruption.
  Even when running the simulations for 20 years post-eruption, the GMST time series are
  still decaying.

      constant. Black lines indicate the median across the ensembles, while shading
      marks the 5th and 95th percentiles.}\label{fig:1_compare_waveform}%
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{ERF dependency on AOD}

  We next focus on the development of the AOD and ERF time series relative to each
  other. Similar comparisons were conducted in \citeA<>[their Fig.\ 4]{gregory2016} and
  \citeA<>[their Fig.\ 1]{marshall2020}, with ERF plotted against AOD.
  Figure~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} displays annual mean values from the five
  simulation cases in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}; the small eruption case (S26)
  as blue downward-pointing triangles, the intermediate eruption case (S400) as orange
  thick diamonds, the large tropical eruption case (S1629) as green upward-pointing
  triangles, the extra large eruption case (S3000) as small pink upward-pointing carets,
  and the large northern hemisphere eruption case (S1629N) as brown upward-pointing
  three-branched twigs. Also shown are the data from \citeA<>[Fig.\ 4, black crosses
    from HadCM3 sstPiHistVol]{gregory2016} as grey crosses labelled G16 (described in
  Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:g16}). Additionally, the estimated peak values from the
  Mt.\ Pinatubo and Mt.\ Tambora eruptions are plotted as a black star and plus, while
  the peak from the \citeA{jones2005} simulation is shown as a pink square labelled J05.
  Finally, red circles represent the peak values obtained from the C2W eruption cases.
  The straight lines are the same as shown by \citeA{gregory2016}. The full data range
  is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}a while
  Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}b highlights a narrow range, focusing on the S26
  case.

  The annual mean data from the Pinatubo-like S26 case in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}b have ERF values as a function of AOD that follow
  almost the same constant slope as the G16 data. However, in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}a we observe that the stronger eruptions lead to
  dissimilar responses in AOD and ERF, where S400 seems to follow close to a \(-10\)
  slope and S1629 is closer to a \(-5\) slope. The peak values (red circles) suggest a
  non-linear dependence, while within each eruption strength (same colour) the annual
  mean values fall relatively close to a straight line.

  \end{figure}

  To investigate the time dependence of the ratio between ERF and AOD, we present
  seasonal means of this ratio in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}. The plot shows the
  eruption cases given in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}, as well as the tropical
  eruptions from \citeA{marshall2020dataset} (\(6\) of \(82\) eruptions), labelled M20
  and described in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:m20}. The S1629 case is similar to S3000
  as indicated in table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}, but is not shown in the plot to
  better highlight S1629N. In Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}a, lines are linear
  regression fits to the seasonal means across all ensemble members, summarised in
  table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Shaded regions are the standard deviation around the
  seasonal means. A similar plot is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b, but
  where the AOD and ERF time series were scaled to have peak values at unity before
  computing the ratio. As the AOD and ERF time series start from zero, the ratio from
  the first season is not included. Likewise, after three years both time series are
  almost fully equilibrated (Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a,b). The data is further
  divided into two periods; a pre-peak period where the peak of both the AOD and the ERF
  is included (consisting of the first post-eruption year), and a post-peak period for
  the decaying part (consisting of the second and third post-eruption years).

  Although the ratio changes across the eruption magnitudes, we find that all the
  tropical cases follow a positive slope during the pre-peak period, as seen in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}a and described in table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}.
  The northern latitude case in S1629N shows a much flatter slope compared to STrop and
  M20. The distinction between the slopes from the tropical and non-tropical cases is
  perhaps more clear in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b and corresponding rows in
  table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Again, S1629N shows an almost flat slope compared to
  the tropical cases. During the post-peak period, more noise is introduced, but a weak
  tendency of negative slopes is found among the tropical cases, as well as in the
  S1629N case up to the last season where the noise is also the largest.

    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  \citeA<>[their Fig.\ 1c,d]{marshall2020} present results that demonstrate a
  time-dependent relationship in the conversion between AOD and ERF. They obtain an ERF
  to AOD ratio with a negative slope when comparing the first post-eruption year to the
  second and third. As such, \citeA{marshall2020} find that, on average, the aerosol
  forcing efficiency increases during the first two to three post-eruption years. This
  phenomenon is explained by \citeA{marshall2020} as the aerosols initially being
  spatially confined to the hemisphere where the eruption occurred. Subsequently, during
  the second and third years, they spread globally, resulting in a higher global-mean
  albedo per AOD and consequently a stronger ERF per AOD ratio with time. However, as
  noted above, a decrease in aerosol forcing efficiency is found when analysing the M20
  data with seasonal resolution during the pre-peak period (first year post-eruption)
  while constraining the ensemble to only include eruptions within \(-10\) to
  \(\SI{10}{\degree\mathrm{N}}\). \note[reviewer1]{L269} The post-peak period shows an
  increasing aerosol forcing efficiency, and during the full first three post-eruption
  years (pre-peak and post-peak), both the tropical subset and the full M20 data yield
  an increasing efficiency, as expected. Likewise, the first three post-eruption years
  of the S400, S3000, and S1629N cases show a weak negative slope and thus an increasing
  efficiency, while S26 shows an elevated post-peak ratio as seen in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b.

  We also note that while the aerosol forcing efficiency is decreasing for tropical M20
  data in the pre-peak period, the full dataset shows increasing efficiency. This is in
  line with what we find from S1629N, which is the only eruption case that does not show
  a clear aerosol forcing efficiency decrease during the pre-peak period.

  \subsection{Parameter scan}

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, we compare the peak values of all investigated
  CESM2 output parameters against each other as well as to injected \ce{SO2}, grouped
  into tropical cases (STrop) and the high-latitude case (S1629N). We also include data
  from \citeA{marshall2020} (M20); \citeA{jones2005} (J05); \citeA{timmreck2010} (T10);
  \citeA{english2013} (E13); \citeA{niemeier2015} (N15); \citeA{ottobliesner2016}
  (OB16); \citeA{brenna2020} (B20); \citeA{osipov2020} (Os20); and \citeA{mcgraw2024}
  (McG24). A description of the climate models used is presented in
  table~\ref{tab:model-family}. Additionally, peak values from Mt.\ Pinatubo (P) and
  Mt.\ Tambora (T) are shown for reference.

  For STrop, we observe in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a an almost linear yet notably
  weakening relationship between AOD peak values and injected \ce{SO2}. The latitude
  also plays a role in the magnitude of the AOD perturbation, evident from S1629N. This
  weak yet notable latitude dependence aligns with findings by \citeA{marshall2019},
  indicating that \(\SI{72}{\percent}\) of the AOD variance can be attributed to
  injected \ce{SO2}, while latitude accounts for only \(\SI{16}{\percent}\) of the
  variance. Peak values from their data (82 simulations) plotted as red thin diamonds
  display a similar pattern, with AOD exhibiting close to linear dependence on injected
  \ce{SO2}, but with latitude introducing a spread in AOD. Peak values from
  Mt.\ Pinatubo (P) and Mt.\ Tambora (T) align well with simulation data, while peak
  values from other simulations of large \ce{SO2} magnitudes (J05, E13, T10, Os20) show
  a larger spread, specifically to weaker AOD response. B20 align well with STrop, which
  also used the CESM2(WACCM6) climate model. Even though E13 did use a similar yet
  simpler and older model in WACCM3, their AOD peak values are significantly smaller
  than what we find here. From the largest eruption simulation by E13 they obtain a peak
  aerosol effective radius of \(R_{\mathrm{EFF}}=\SI{1.9}{\micro\meter}\), which is much
  bigger than the \(R_{\mathrm{EFF}}=\SI{0.7}{\micro\meter}\) obtained by B20 for
  eruptions injecting half as much \ce{SO2} as E13, and using the same climate model as
  us.

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b, ERF plotted against injected \ce{SO2} (with the
  absolute value of ERF on the \(y\)-axis) indicates a substantial damping effect on ERF
  as injected \ce{SO2} increases for the STrop data, in agreement with results from
  OB16. The OB16 data come from a \(2500\) year long simulation using historic volcanoes
  as the only external forcing. The analysis details of OB16 can be found in Appendix B,
  section~\ref{ap:ob16}. Despite the model complexity difference,
  \citeA{ottobliesner2016}'s simulations using Community Earth System Model version 1
  (CESM1) with a low-top atmosphere (CAM5) produce ERFs comparable to our findings. Both
  B20 and McG24 align well with STrop, and while B20 uses the same climate model, McG24
  uses the GISS ModelE2.1 but where a fixed aerosol effective radius of
  \(R_{\text{EFF}}=\SI{0.6}{\micro\meter}\) was used. This \(R_{\text{EFF}}\) is at the
  lower end of their simulations, which is shown by \citeA{mcgraw2024} to produce the
  most extreme ERF and GMST perturbations.

  \citeA{niemeier2015} conducted simulations of continuous sulphur injections up to
  \(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\) in the ECHAM5's middle atmosphere
  version \cite{giorgetta2006} with aerosol microphysics from HAM \cite{stier2005}. They
  observed an ERF dependence on \ce{SO2} injection rate following an inverse
  exponential, which converges to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\), depicted in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b as the stippled pink line labelled N15 and given as;
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta R_{\mathrm{TOA}}(x) = -\SI{65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}
    \exp\left[-{\left(\frac{\SI{2246}{\tera\gram(S)yr^{-1}}}{x}\right)}^{0.23}\right].
    \label{eq:niemeier_exponential}
  \end{equation}
  Here, x is... The results by N15, on which Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} is based, are all
  averages over at least three years of steady sulphur burdens, substantially longer
  than the time it takes for ERF to reach peak values after an eruption. Combined with
  their lack of a full chemistry model \cite{niemeier2015}, a direct comparison between
  Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} to peak ERF values (occurring about one year
  post-eruption) may not reflect the same chemical and physical processes. In
  Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}, \(x\) represents \ce{S}, while the axis shows
  values of \ce{SO2}, thus halving of the \ce{SO2} values on the axis gives the
  appropriate shape of Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} as a function of \ce{S}.

  With these caveats in mind, we observe that even though most simulations exhibit a
  notably faster increase than the exponential relationship, T10's results closely align
  with the function described in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Starting with an
  initial input of \(\SI{850}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})}\) (equivalent to
  \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), representing the YTT eruption), their estimated
  AOD led to a peak ERF of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\), depicted as a pink filled
  circle in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b. The results from T10 came from a
  simulation using the MPI-ESM climate model, driven by AOD data from the HAM aerosol
  model. This alignment likely stems from the utilization of the same aerosol
  microphysical model in both \citeA{timmreck2010} and \citeA{niemeier2015}, as well as
  the application of similar climate models, MPI-ESM and ECHAM5, respectively. The
  relationship between climate model families and their implications are further
  described in Appendix C. Notably, the peak values from M20 fit well within an upper
  boundary defined by STrop and OB16, and a lower boundary defined by
  Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Eruptions closer to the equator within M20 align
  with data points near the upper boundary, whereas eruptions at more extreme latitudes
  tend to yield weaker peak ERF values, closer to the lower boundary. Importantly, none
  of the eruption simulations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b exceeded the
  upper threshold of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\) as suggested in
  Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.

  Figure~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}c illustrates the response of GMST against injected
  \ce{SO2}. The increase in GMST response with injected \ce{SO2} decreases for higher
  injected \ce{SO2}, showing a similar relationship between STrop, S1629N, OB16, B20,
  and McG24. Notably, T10 and J05 exhibit respectively much weaker and much stronger
  GMST responses to injected \ce{SO2} than STrop, while Os20 cover a wide range in GMST
  for the same injceted \ce{SO2} of \(\SI{2000}{\tera\gram(SO_{2})}\). In Os20 they
  removed a single mechanism at the time, with four experiments with GMST between
  \(\SI{5.5}{\kelvin}\) and \(\SI{6}{\kelvin}\), and one at \(\sim \SI{10.5}{\kelvin}\).
  For this outlier, feedback on photochemistry due to aerosols had been switched off
  \cite{osipov2020}. T10 has a maximum GMST anomaly of only \(\SI{-3.5}{\kelvin}\) for
  their \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) eruption, while J05 records a substantially
  larger maximum GMST anomaly of \(\SI{-10.7}{\kelvin}\). Since the M20 experiment was
  conducted with prescribed sea-surface temperatures \cite{marshall2020}, preventing the
  GMST from being fully perturbed, \note[reviewer1]{L338} we do not focus on the M20
  data in the GMST plots but include them for completeness.

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d, we revisit the relationship between ERF and AOD,
  focusing on peak values rather than annual and seasonal averages. As previously
  discussed, the ERF to AOD ratio displays weaker slopes than previous studies, with the
  STrop peak values not conforming to a linear trend. The relationship between ERF and
  AOD suggests potential substantial dependencies on the model and its input parameters,
  such as latitude, but most notably to an inherent non-linear ERF dependence on AOD.
  Both the G16 data in Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} and the J05 data originate from
  the same climate model. Similarly to what we find from the STrop data, the ratio is
  much stronger for small eruptions in the industrial era (G16) compared to the
  super-volcano eruption (J05).

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e, we again find that the response of the STrop data
  decreases with increasing AOD, this time in GMST anomaly. Additionally, both S1629N
  and B20 align well with STrop, with T10, and J05 and Os20 following a similar
  dependence, albeit somewhat weaker and stronger, respectively.

  Finally, in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}f, we compare the GMST and ERF responses.
  Both STrop and OB16 show a near-linear relationship between GMST and ERF. The STrop
  data indicate a steeper slope, implying stronger GMST perturbations as compared to
  OB16. However, potential biases exist in the values from the analysis of OB16, as
  outlined in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:ob16}. This, along with considerable noise,
  results in the analysis of OB16 GMST anomalies being less reliable. All other cases
  (S1629N, J05, T10, B20, McG24) closely follow the linear GMST to ERF dependence of
  STrop.

  The almost linear relationship between AOD and injected \ce{SO2} for the STrop data in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a suggests a comparable trend for ERF versus injected
  \ce{SO2} in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b, as seen for ERF versus AOD in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d. For the same reason, we expect
  Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e to show a similar pattern for STrop as observed in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}c.

  This relationship, along with the functional relationships between all other
  parameters shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, are illustrated in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:5_diagram_of_function_relations}. There, \annote[reviewer1]{we show that
    from assuming a linear dependency of AOD on injected \protect\ce{SO2}}{why is this
    being assumed when it has been shown this isn't very valid?}

  \(h(x)=f(cx+d)=g(ax+b)\), and finally that \(h(x)=k(acx+ad+b)\), concluding that
  \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), and \(k\) have the same functional form.

  \subsection{Climate sensitivity estimate}

  As previously mentioned, the J05 experiment is similar to S1629 concerning ERF values,
  yet differ in both AOD and GMST. At the same time J05 is similar to S3000 in AOD and
  ERF. To investigate this discrepancy, we here conduct a comparison between the J05
  climate feedback parameter \(\alpha\) (where \(s=1/\alpha\) is the climate sensitivity
  parameter) with our climate resistance, denoted as \(\rho\), and the transient climate
  response parameter (TCRP) \(1/\rho\) (where \(\mathrm{TCS}=F_{2\times\ce{CO2}}\times
  \mathrm{TCRP}\) is the transient climate sensitivity and \(F_{2\times\ce{CO2}}\) is
  the forcing due to a doubling of pre-industrial \ce{CO2} concentration).
  \note[reviewer1]{L378} As the forcing of volcanic eruptions last for too short time
  for \(F=\rho T\) to remain valid, an alternative approach using a time-integral form
  introduced by \citeA{merlis2014} is applied:

  \begin{equation}
    \int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t=\rho\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t
    \label{eq:climate-resistance-orig}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \rho=\frac{\int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t}{\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t}.
    \label{eq:climate-resistance}
  \end{equation}

  If the upper bound of the integral, \(\tau\), is sufficiently large, so that the upper
  ocean heat content is the same at \(t=0\) and \(t=\tau\) (\citeA{merlis2014} used
  \(\tau =\SI{15}{\mathrm{yr}}\)), this approach agrees with \(F=\rho T\) for long-term
  forcing \cite{gregory2016}. Additionally, we note that the climate resistance and the
  climate feedback parameter are associated with the ocean heat uptake efficiency
  (\(\kappa\)) through \(\rho =\alpha +\kappa\) \cite{gregory2016}.

  The climate feedback parameter estimated by \citeA{jones2005} is \(\alpha \simeq
  \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), exceeding twice the value obtained by
  \citeA{gregory2016} in their simulations of Mt.\ Pinatubo using the same HadCM3
  climate model. We determine the climate resistance using the integral-form computation
  outlined in Eq.~\ref{eq:climate-resistance} and adopting \(\tau
  =\SI{20}{\mathrm{yr}}\). The estimated climate resistance from the three tropical
  simulation cases (with four in each ensemble) converges to \(\rho
  =\SI{2.5(4)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), and TCRP values of
  \(1/\rho=\SI{0.41(5)}{\kelvin\watt^{-1}\metre^{2}}\), as reported in
  table~\ref{tab:trcp}, and is therefore assumed to be a good estimate of \(\alpha\).

  Importantly, our estimate agrees well with G16, while the J05 estimate of \(\alpha
  \simeq \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\) is still notably higher. Since the GMST
  perturbation obtained by J05 was larger than in any of our CESM2 cases, it indicates
  that the forcing used by J05 must be stronger. \note[reviewer1]{L398} The peak value
  of the J05 ERF is similar to the S1629 case, and as such, the overall stronger forcing
  must originate from the development of the forcing time series rather than the peak
  value. This is in line with recent studies investigating the effect of different
  aerosol effective radius. \citeA{mcgraw2024} find that from supereruptions, it is
  possible to achieve even a warming of the GMST. However, as our model results align
  well with the results of \citeA{mcgraw2024} using a small aerosol effective radius of
  \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}=\SI{0.6}{\micro\meter}\), we expect the peak GMST from
  CESM2(WACCM6) to be close to a lower bound, and as such the even colder GMST
  perturbation of \citeA{jones2005} is too extreme.

  % ERF / AOD linearity does not hold for large eruptions
  Figures~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes},~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}, and
  \ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d demonstrate that as the AOD exceeds approximately \(1.0\),
  the linear ERF dependence of approximately
  \(\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) no longer holds. The sublinear
  increase in ERF with injected \ce{SO2} in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b for large
  eruptions is consistent with previous results from simulations using similar climate
  models of smaller historic eruptions (G16) and of supereruptions (J05). Such a change
  in ratio has been attributed to larger eruptions, injecting more \ce{SO2}, leading to
  larger aerosols, and hence less effective radiation scattering, thereby reducing the
  ERF for the same injected \ce{SO2} \cite{english2013, timmreck2010, timmreck2018}.
  Similarly, previous studies have suggested a two-thirds power law relationship between
  peek AOD and injected \ce{SO2} for eruptions larger in magnitude than than the Mt.\
  Tambora eruption \cite{crowley2013,metzner2014,timmreck2024}. Furthermore, CESM(WACCM)
  has been shown to simulate smaller aerosols than most other climate models
  \cite{clyne2021}, resulting in an increased AOD peak value and \(e\)-folding time
  \cite{zanchettin2016,clyne2021}. Thus, the sublinear relationship for AOD and ERF to
  injected \ce{SO2} from CESM2(WACCM6) is likely an upper bound.

  % Latitude is more important for the development of the ERF / AOD ratio
  The non-linear relationship between peak ERF and AOD values is a strong signature in
  both Figs.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} and~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}. Across
  eruptions of the same strength, the ratio stays relatively constant, leading to a
  close to \(\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) slope for S400 and a
  \(\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) slope for S1629 and S3000. Still, a
  non-linear development in the ERF to AOD ratio is found across all tropical eruptions.
  Similar to the results of \citeA{marshall2020}, we find in S400, S1629, and S3000 that
  the post-peak period (second and third post-eruption years) has a stronger aerosol
  forcing efficiency compared to the pre-peak period (first post-eruption year). The
  post-peak period of S26 is elevated as compared to the pre-peak period, resulting in a
  decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency from the first to the second and third
  post-eruption years, in contrast to the other tropical eruptions.

  Focusing on the pre-peak period, we find tropical eruptions to differ from eruptions
  at high latitudes. During the pre-peak period, all tropical eruptions show a
  decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency, while no significant change in the ERF to AOD
  ratio is found from the S1629N case. The full M20 dataset indicates an increasing
  aerosol forcing efficiency also during the pre-peak period, contrasting the decreasing
  efficiency found from their tropical eruptions and supporting the latitudinal
  dependence we find with S1629N. While we find a linear relationship to be a useful
  approximation of ERF dependence on AOD for eruptions similar to or smaller than Mt.\
  Pinatubo, additional factors must be considered for larger eruptions. These factors,
  such as \ce{OH} scarcity and aerosol growth, influence reflectance and their
  gravitational pull, substantially impacting both AOD and ERF evolution, as highlighted
  by \citeA{timmreck2010}. The large difference in ratio found when comparing eruption
  magnitudes suggests that injected \ce{SO2} is crucial when estimating the time-average
  of the ERF to AOD ratio. However, latitude and, in particular, aerosol dispersion are
  more influential in determining the post-eruption evolution of the ratio, particularly
  during the pre-peak period.

  We find that the suggested upper threshold from Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} is
  not violated by any eruption simulation, and most notably that the GMST peak value
  follow the ERF trend in reaching a limiting value. The STrop cases follow a close to
  linear GMST dependency on ERF, with S1629N, J05, T10, B20, and McG24 all aligning
  close to the same slope. The linear relationship between GMST and ERF is the clearest
  dependence found between the parameters in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, both eruption magnitudes and latitudes, but also across highly
  different climate models. Thus, from a maximum ERF of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\),
  we expect GMST anomalies to reach at most \(\sim\SI{-10}{\kelvin}\), in support of
  \citeA{english2013} who suggested that large eruptions can be self-limiting.

  % Models vary in their SO2 to H2SO4 chemistry/physics, but are comparatively
  % consistent in representing AOD, ERF and GMST.
  The biggest spread in the data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan} is found when
  relating injected \ce{SO2} to any of the three output parameters. As the amount of
  injected \ce{SO2} increases, both AOD, ERF, and GMST across models have a big spread.
  The AOD to injected \ce{SO2} relationship is consistent within similar models, even
  when comparing simulations of volcanic eruptions \cite{timmreck2010} and continuous
  injection of \ce{SO2} \cite{niemeier2015}, but has a wide spread at high values of
  injected \ce{SO2} across model families (Figs.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a,b,c).
  Comparatively, the ERF (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d) and GMST
  (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e) as a function of AOD, as well as GMST as a function
  of ERF (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}f), demonstrate a smaller spread across models.
  \citeA{marshall2019, marshall2020, marshall2021} use a code with seven log-normal
  modes to simulate aerosol mass and number concentrations, along with an
  atmosphere-only configuration of the UM-UKCA with prescribed sea-surface temperatures
  and sea-ice extent \cite{marshall2019}. This approach is in contrast with CESM2,
  operating as an Earth System Model, but with a simpler aerosol chemistry model in the
  MAM3. The family of models to which M20 is based is different from that of C2W and
  OB16, and also different from the T10 and N15, as described in Appendix C. Based on
  Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, we find the model family to be pivotal in determining
  the estimated AOD and ERF magnitudes from injected \ce{SO2}, whereas the various
  models generally demonstrate more consistency in representing ERF from AOD.

  % AOD time series are different across eruption magnitudes, and peak at later times
  \citeA{timmreck2010} highlights that for sufficiently large eruptions, \ce{OH}
  radicals are too scarce, which limits \ce{SO2} oxidation. The AOD peak in the YTT
  simulation of T10 occurs six months after Mt.\ Pinatubo's peak. This aligns with our
  results, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a, where S26 shows an
  earlier AOD peak compared to S400, S1629, and S3000. While the peak ERF value of T10
  occurs \(7\)--\(8\) months post-eruption, similar to STrop, the J05 peak anomaly
  occurs one year post-eruption. Additionally, as \citeA{jones2005} obtains a climate
  feedback parameter larger than both what \citeA{gregory2016} found for the same
  climate model and larger than the climate resistance obtained here from STrop, we
  conclude that their estimated GMST is likely too extreme.

  \section{Summary and conclusions}

  \label{sec:conclusions}

  We consider five ensembles of Mt.\ Pinatubo-sized to supereruption sized events and
  compare them to previously reported results. We find the commonly adopted ERF
  dependence on AOD of \(\sim\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) to be
  representative for Mt.\
  Pinatubo-sized eruptions. Larger eruptions, with one to two orders of magnitude larger
  injections of \ce{SO2}, are found to have an ERF dependence on AOD closer to
  \(\sim\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) and
  \(\sim\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\). A shallower slope for larger
  eruptions is also consistent with peak values from previous studies of supereruptions.

  The time-after-eruption dependence of the ratio between ERF and AOD is found to weaken
  with time, resulting in a decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency in the pre-peak
  period. The effect is found across all eruption sizes, but only the tropical cases
  show a clear trend. The high-latitude case displays an almost constant efficiency with
  time. These results agree with a reanalysis of the tropical data in
  \citeA{marshall2020dataset}. Thus, these findings provide strong supporting evidence
  that latitude is generally significant in determining the aerosol forcing efficiency,
  particularly as a function of time-after-eruption. These findings emphasise the
  complexity of volcanic impacts on climate, demonstrating significant differences in
  climatic response depending on eruption magnitude and latitude.

  A clear trend across all simulations performed here and across several previous
  studies is a linear relationship between peek GMST and ERF. Further, the peak values
  seem to stagnate with no ERF peaks breaking the suggested lower bound of
  \(\text{ERF}=\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) by \citeA{niemeier2015}. Thus, we expect
  supereruptions to be self-limiting with the most extreme GMST perturbations reaching
  at most \(~\sim \SI{-10}{\kelvin}\).

  We find that the AOD peak arrives later for larger eruptions than for smaller ones,
  and also that larger eruptions produce a sharper peak in the AOD time series. The ERF
  time series are similar across all eruption sizes, and while the smallest eruption
  experiences a faster GMST decay, the larger eruptions produce time series
  indistinguishable in development for both ERF and GMST. Thus, a simple scaling of the
  AOD or GMST time series from a smaller eruption is insufficient in representing that
  of larger volcanic eruptions.

  Considering injected \ce{SO2} and the peak values of AOD and ERF, a large spread is
  found across model families in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}. Improving the
  consistency between model families in how the chemistry and physics of \ce{SO2} and
  \ce{H2SO4} are represented is an important step in enhancing the accuracy of simulated
  volcanic eruptions' influence on climate by models. More simulations of larger
  volcanic eruptions with injected \ce{SO2} greater than
  \(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\mathrm{SO2})}\) would provide useful information for a more
  precise determination of the ERF to AOD ratio in the non-linear regime. This would
  also serve as a useful test to check if a comparison between \ce{SO2} injection events
  and continuous \ce{SO2} injection is reasonable. Introducing a spread in latitude
  similar to the \citeA{marshall2020dataset} dataset would allow for better comparison
  between eruptions across all latitudes and the suggested lower limit following
  Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}, describing a situation of aerosol saturation.

  \appendix

  \section{Simulation setup}

  Input files used in the simulations were created by modifying the file available at \url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl},
  using a Python package available on GitHub at
  \url{https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking} or through the Python Package Index
  (PyPI). The package is available both as a library and a Command Line Interface (CLI),
  and is used to create volcanic eruptions with a specified amount of \ce{SO2} that is
  injected over six hours at a given latitude, longitude, and altitude. All volcanic
  \ce{SO2} files are created from a shell script by setting the eruption details in a
  JSON file that is read by the \texttt{volcano-cooking} CLI at a fixed version,
  ensuring a reproducible experiment setup.

  During analysis, one outlier was found in the ensemble representing S26, specifically
  in the GMST time series. This ensemble member was the February 15, 1850, eruption,
  which was changed in favour of a February 15, 1851, eruption in the S26, S400, and
  S1629 ensembles. For completeness, the February 15, 1850, eruption is still included
  in the online archive.

  \section{External data}

  \subsection{Otto-Bliesner data analysis}

  \label{ap:ob16}

  Data from \citeA{ottobliesner2016} are the original input data of injected \ce{SO2} as
  used in their model simulations, along with ERF and GMST output data. The injected
  \ce{SO2} can be found at
  \url{https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/paleo/simulations/ccsm4-lm}. Only the
  peak values of the \ce{SO2} dataset were used in the analysis. Output variables are
  available at \url{www2.cesm.ucar.edu/models/experiments/LME}.

  Since the OB16 dataset contains a five-member ensemble, the final ERF and GMST time
  series used were ensemble means. A single control simulation time series is used to
  remove seasonal dependence from the GMST, where the control simulation is averaged
  into a climatology mean. Further, a drift in the GMST is removed by subtracting a
  linear regression fit. ERF has seasonality removed in the Fourier domain.

  The time of an eruption is found based on a best attempt at aligning the \ce{SO2} time
  series with both the ERF time series and the GMST time series. The ERF and GMST peak
  values are taken as the value of the time series at the time of an eruption according
  to the \ce{SO2} time series. Missing the true peak means the found peaks will be
  biased towards lower values. However, instances where eruptions occur close in time
  will contribute a bias to higher values. These biases contribute to a greater
  uncertainty related to OB16 in Figs.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b,c,f.

  \subsection{Marshall data analysis}

  \label{ap:m20}

  Data used to compute the M20 values were from \citeA{marshall2020dataset}, available
  at \url{https://doi.org/10.5285/232164e8b1444978a41f2acf8bbbfe91}. As each file
  includes a single eruption, peak values of AOD, ERF, and GMST were found by applying a
  Savitzky-Golay filter of third order and one-year window length, and choosing the
  maximum value \cite{savitzky1964}.

  \subsection{Gregory data analysis}

  \label{ap:g16}

  Data used to compute G16 values were kindly provided by Jonathan Gregory (personal
  communication). The full 160-year-long time series were further analysed by computing
  annual means.

  \section{Model families}

  The model used here was the CESM2 with the WACCM6 atmosphere in the MA configuration.
  The MA configuration uses the MAM3 \cite{gettleman2019}, a simplified and
  computationally efficient default setting within the CAM5 \cite{liu2016}, as described
  in \citeA{liu2012}. The MAM3 was developed from MAM7, consisting of the seven modes
  Aitken, accumulation, primary carbon, fine dust, fine sea salt, coarse dust, and
  coarse sea salt. Instantaneous internal mixing of primary carbonaceous aerosols with
  secondary aerosols and instantaneous ageing of primary carbonaceous particles are
  assumed by emitting primary carbon in the accumulation mode \cite{liu2016}. As dust
  absorbs water efficiently and is expected to be removed by wet deposition similarly to
  sea salt, fine dust is merged with fine sea salt into the accumulation mode and coarse
  dust is merged with coarse sea salt into a coarse mode. The coarse mode will quickly
  revert to its background state below the tropopause \cite{liu2012}. Consequently, MAM3
  features the three modes Aitken, accumulation, and coarse \cite{liu2016}.

  The CESM2 is an ancestor of CESM1 used by OB16. They belong to a different model
  family than both the HadCM3 (J05 and G16) and the UM-UKCA (M20), which is an extended
  version of HadGEM3 \cite{dhomse2014}, and an ancestor of HadCM3. A third model family
  is represented through ECHAM5 (N15) and MPI-ESM (T10), where the latter is related to
  the former via the ECHAM6. A summary of the model code genealogy is in
  table~\ref{tab:model-family}, based on the model code genealogy map created by
  \citeA{kuma2023}.
