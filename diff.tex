  Although \ce{H2O}, \ce{N2}, and \ce{CO2} are the most abundant gases emitted by
  volcanoes \cite{robock2000}, sulphur species such as \ce{SO2} provide a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{comparatively

\cite{rampino1982,pinto1989,marshall2019}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD

  \cite{pitari2016b} and the season of the year (determining to which hemisphere
  aerosols are transported) \cite{toohey2011,toohey2019}. In the case of tropical
  eruptions, aerosols are typically transported poleward in the stratosphere and descend
  back to mid-latitude troposphere within one to two years \cite{robock2000}. Upon
  descending below the tropopause, these aerosols are readily removed by wet deposition
  \cite{liu2012}.

  eruptions were the primary forcing mechanism behind Earth's climate variability during
  the Holocene period \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{schurer2013}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Despite this substantial impact, few
  climate-model experiments have included volcanic forcing when simulating climate
  evolution during the Holocene \cite{sigl2022}, likely implying an exaggerated positive
  forcing \cite{gregory2016,solomon2011}. This absence of persistent cooling is one of
  several factors that have been suggested to contribute to the common disparity between
  simulated and observed global warming \cite{andersson2015}. Despite extensive
  attention on understanding the way volcanic eruptions influence climate, questions
  regarding aerosol particle processes---such as growth and creation rates when \ce{OH}
  is scarce---remain unanswered

  impact aerosol scattering efficiency and potentially the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD relationship.
  \citeA{marshall2020} observe higher aerosol forcing efficiency in post-eruption years
  \(2\) and \(3\) compared to year 1, and attribute this post-eruption increase in
  aerosol forcing efficiency to strong spatial concentration in the initial year and
  subsequent distribution of aerosols over a larger area. This spatial redistribution
  increases the albedo per global mean AOD thereby causing a stronger \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD ratio
  \cite{marshall2020}.

  Previous studies of both Mt.\ Pinatubo \cite{mills2017,hansen2005} and volcanoes
  within the instrumental era \cite{gregory2016} have been used to estimate the
  relationship between the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend energy imbalance and change in AOD\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{caused by volcanic

  simulations featuring varying injection heights and latitudes of volcanic emissions,
  with injected \ce{SO2} ranging from \(10\) to \(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

  A similar simulation setup, albeit with notable differences, was conducted by
  \citeA{niemeier2015}, involving an ensemble of \(14\) levels of injected sulphur

  substantial variability exists in the slope among studies
  \cite{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Moreover, a
  time-after-eruption dependence on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD ratio is found in
  \citeA{marshall2020}, whereas \citeA{niemeier2015} revealed a non-linear relationship
  between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend and injected \ce{SO2} rate. Thus, a consensus on the relationship between
  injected \ce{SO2}, AOD, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend has yet to be established.

  One avenue that has garnered considerable attention is comparing the magnitude of
  volcanic or volcano-like forcings to increased \ce{CO2} levels. Several studies
  explore the connection between volcanic forcing and the climate sensitivity to a
  doubling of \ce{CO2}
  \cite{boer2007,marvel2016,merlis2014,ollila2016,richardson2019,salvi2022,wigley2005}.
  The comparison of forcing from volcanoes and \ce{CO2} aims to mitigate the large
  uncertainty in estimates of the sensitivity of the real climate system. Inferring
  climate sensitivity from volcanic eruption events has been attempted as a way to
  constrain the sensitivity \cite{boer2007} by assuming that volcanic and \ce{CO2}
  forcings produce similar feedbacks \cite{pauling2023}. Earlier studies suggest the
  potential for constraining equilibrium cilmate sensitivity (ECS) using volcanoes
  \cite{bender2010}, provided that ECS is constrained by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effective radiative forcing
  (ERF ) rather than instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF rather than IRF}\DIFaddend , as ERF
  accounts for rapid atmospheric adjustments in contrast to IRF
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{smith2018,richardson2019,marshall2020}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . However, other studies refute this
  approach, pointing out that different sensitivities of volcanic forcing and \ce{CO2}
  doubling seem to exist \cite{douglass2006}, or that constraining the ECS by ERF lacks
  accuracy due to the precision of climate simulations \cite{boer2007,salvi2022}.
  Although ERF offers a more suitable indicator of forcing than IRF
  \cite{marvel2016,richardson2019}, more recent studies conclude that ECS cannot be
  constrained from volcanic eruption events \cite{pauling2023}.

  covering three orders of magnitude and the inclusion of one high latitude eruption of
  the second largest injected \ce{SO2} case.

  We conducted ensemble simulations of volcanic eruptions in the Community Earth System
  Model Version 2 (CESM2) coupled with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
  Version 6 (WACCM6). The ensembles span four different levels of injected \ce{SO2}:
  \(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\),
  \(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) and \(\SI{3000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\). Details
  regarding the experimental setup are provided in section~\ref{sec:method}. Our
  findings reveal non-linear \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD dependencies for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{medium }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{large }\DIFaddend to super-volcano size
  eruptions. Additionally, we observe a time-dependent variation in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD
  ratio, detailed in section~\ref{sec:results} and discussed in
  section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Furthermore, our data, along with insights from previous
  studies, suggest that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend dependency on injected \ce{SO2} identified by
  \citeA{niemeier2015} acts as a lower boundary. Our conclusions are presented in

\DIFdelend \subsection{Model}

  We use the CESM2 \cite{danabasoglu2020} in conjunction with the WACCM6
  \cite{gettleman2019} and the fully dynamical ocean component Parallel Ocean Program
  version 2 (POP2) \cite{smith2010, danabasoglu2020}. The atmosphere model was run at a
  nominal \(\SI{2}{\degree}\) resolution with \(70\) vertical levels in the middle
  atmosphere (MA) configuration.

  The WACCM6 version employed in the MA configuration uses the three mode version of the
  Modal Aerosol Module (MAM3) \cite{gettleman2019}, a simplified and computationally
  efficient default setting within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5)
  \cite{liu2016}, as described in \citeA{liu2012}. The MAM3 was developed from MAM7 and
  features the modes Aitken, accumulation, and coarse \cite{liu2016}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and further
  updated to simulate stratospheric sulfate aerosol from volcanic and non-volcanic
  emissions in WACCM \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{mills2016}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

  \subsection{Simulations}

  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We are using the coupled model version BWma1850 component setup to run the CESM2 with
  a fully dynamic ocean component to get estimates of the GMST, and an accompanying
  fixed sea-surface temperature version, fSST1850, providing estimates of the ERF and
  AOD. The applied fSST1850 is not from a standardised component setup of CESM2 but is
  instead explicitly specified as }\url{1850_CAM60

    %
  }\DIFadd{. %DIF >  Necessary to make the formatter not break the URL / literal text
  The component setup BWma1850 and fSST1850 differ in that the latter uses a prescribed
  sea-ice (}\texttt{\DIFadd{CICE -> CICE\%PRES}}\DIFadd{), a prescribed data ocean (}\texttt{\DIFadd{POP2\%ECO\%DEP
    -> DOCN\%DOM}}\DIFadd{) and a stub wave component instead of the full Wave Watch version 3
  (}\texttt{\DIFadd{WW3 -> SWAV}}\DIFadd{).
}

  \DIFadd{The important input data used in the model simulations are injected \ce{SO2} in units
  of teragrams (\(\si{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\)), used to simulate volcanic eruptions. ERF
  is calculated as the combined (short wave and long wave) all-sky TOA energy imbalance,
  where the CESM2 provide the output variables ``net solar flux at the top of the
  model'' (FSNT) and ``net longwave flux at the top of the model'' (FLNT). Thus,
  \(\mathrm{ERF_*}= \mathrm{FSNT} - \mathrm{FLNT}\), and taking the difference between
  volcanic forcing simulations and a control simulation gives the final estimate of ERF
  (\(\mathrm{ERF}=\mathrm{ERF_{VOLC}}-\mathrm{ERF_{CONTROL}}\)) \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{marshall2020}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. The
  ERF calculation uses the fSST1850 component setup, which is also used to obtain all
  other simulation output fields except from GMST which uses BWma1850. The AOD is
  obtained from the output variable ``stratospheric aerosol optical depth 550 nm day
  night'' (AODVISstdn), while GMST is saved by CESM2 to the variable ``reference height
  temperature'' (TREFHT). The analysis of this work is performed using these four
  variables.
}

  \DIFaddend Appendix A provides a description of the simulation setup\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and utilised output
  variables}\DIFdelend .
  Table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} summarises the simulations, encompassing four
  \ce{SO2} injection magnitudes and up to four seasons: 15 February, 15 May, 15 August,

  \subsection{Analysis of the time series}

  Figure~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} presents time series of global mean AOD, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF, and
  surface air temperature}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF, and
  GMST}\DIFaddend . The black lines represent the medians across the ensembles, while shading
  indicates the 5th to 95th percentiles. The four distinct forcing magnitudes (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\downarrow\),
  C2W\(-\), C2W\(\uparrow\), and C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26,
  S400, S1629, and S3000}\DIFaddend ) outlined in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} have been
  used. The time series in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} are normalised by setting
  the peak value to unity, defined based on the peak of a fit from a Savitzky-Golay
  filter of 3rd order and a one-year window length \cite{savitzky1964}.

  A notable feature across the subfigures of Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform} is the
  peak occurrence of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\downarrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26 }\DIFaddend case compared to the larger eruption cases. The peak of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\downarrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26
  }\DIFaddend arrives earlier for both \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalised }\DIFaddend AOD (Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a) and
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalised GMST }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}c), \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \annote[reviewer1]{while the RF time series in
%DIFDELCMD <     Fig.~\protect\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}b are all indistinguishable}{importantly

\DIFdel{.Cases C2W\(-\),
  C2W\(\uparrow\), and C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{while the normalised ERF time
  series in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}b are all indistinguishable. Cases S400,
  S1629, and S3000 }\DIFaddend are indistinguishable in their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalised GMST }\DIFaddend development, and while
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\downarrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26 }\DIFaddend peaks at an earlier time, it decays similarly to the other cases. Interestingly,
  the same development between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(-\) and C2W\(\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S400 and S1629 }\DIFaddend is not found in the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalised }\DIFaddend AOD time
  series. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\downarrow\)
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26 }\DIFaddend peaks at an earlier time, but also spends more time around the peak and as
  such decays at a later time post-eruption. Likewise, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(-\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S400 }\DIFaddend has a faster rise and slower
  decay compared to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629}\DIFaddend , but where both peak at a similar time. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\)

  the peak.

  The timescale of the perturbation of AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend is shorter than that of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST}\DIFaddend .
  While the AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend time series return to their equilibrium state within roughly
  three years, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend time series remain heavily perturbed three years post-eruption.
  Even when running the simulations for 20 years post-eruption, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend time series are
  still decaying.

  \subsection{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend dependency on AOD}

  We next focus on the development of the AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend time series relative to each
  other. Similar comparisons were conducted in \citeA<>[their Fig.\ 4]{gregory2016} and
  \citeA<>[their Fig.\ 1]{marshall2020}, with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend plotted against AOD.
  Figure~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} displays annual mean values from the five
  simulation cases in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the small eruption case
  (C2W\(\downarrow\)) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26 }\DIFaddend as blue downward-pointing
  triangles, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the intermediate eruption

  (C2W\(\uparrow\)) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629 }\DIFaddend as green upward-pointing triangles,
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the extra large eruption case
  (C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\)) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S3000 }\DIFaddend as small pink upward-pointing carets, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the large northern
  hemisphere eruption case (C2WN\(\uparrow\)) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N }\DIFaddend as brown upward-pointing
  three-branched twigs. Also shown are the data from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend as grey crosses labelled G16 (described in Appendix B,
  section~\ref{ap:g16}). Additionally, the estimated peak values from the Mt.\ Pinatubo
  and Mt.\ Tambora eruptions are plotted as a black star and plus, while the peak from
  the \citeA{jones2005} simulation is shown as a pink square labelled J05. Finally, red
  circles represent the peak values obtained from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop }\DIFaddend eruption cases. The straight
  lines are the same as shown by \citeA{gregory2016}. The full data range is shown in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}a while Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}b highlights
  a narrow range, focusing on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the C2W\(\downarrow\) case}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26}\DIFaddend .

  The annual mean data from the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Mt.\ }\DIFaddend Pinatubo-like \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\downarrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26 }\DIFaddend case in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}b have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend values as a function of AOD that follow
  almost the same constant slope as the G16 data. However, in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes}a we observe that the stronger eruptions lead to
  dissimilar responses in AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF, where C2W\(-\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF, where S400 }\DIFaddend seems to follow close to a \(-10\)
  slope and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629 }\DIFaddend is closer to a \(-5\) slope. The peak values (red circles) suggest a
  non-linear dependence, while within each eruption strength (same colour) the annual
  mean values fall relatively close to a straight line.

  \end{figure}

  To investigate the time dependence of the ratio between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend and AOD, we present
  seasonal means of this ratio in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}. The plot shows the
  eruption cases given in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}, as well as the tropical
  eruptions from \citeA{marshall2020dataset} (\(6\) of \(82\) eruptions), labelled M20
  and described in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:m20}. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629 }\DIFaddend case is similar to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S3000
  }\DIFaddend as indicated in table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}, but is not shown in the plot to
  better highlight \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WN\(\uparrow\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N}\DIFaddend . In Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}a, lines are linear
  regression fits to the seasonal means across all ensemble members, summarised in
  table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Shaded regions are the standard deviation around the
  seasonal means. A similar \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{shading
  is plotted }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{plot is presented }\DIFaddend in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b, but
  where the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regression fits have been omitted for clarity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{AOD and ERF time series were scaled to have peak values at unity before
  computing the ratio}\DIFaddend . As the AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend time series start from zero, the ratio from
  the first season is not included. Likewise, after three years both time series are
  almost fully equilibrated (Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a,b). The data is further
  divided into two periods; a pre-peak period where the peak of both the AOD and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF
  }\DIFaddend is included (consisting of the first post-eruption year), and a post-peak period for
  the decaying part (consisting of the second and third post-eruption years).

  Although the ratio changes across the eruption magnitudes, we find that all the
  tropical cases follow a positive slope during the pre-peak period, as seen in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}a and described in table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}.
  The northern latitude case in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WN\(\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N }\DIFaddend shows a much flatter slope compared to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WTrop }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop }\DIFaddend and
  M20. The distinction between the slopes from the tropical and non-tropical cases is
  perhaps more clear in Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b and corresponding rows in
  table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Again, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WN\(\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N }\DIFaddend shows an almost flat slope compared to
  the tropical cases. During the post-peak period, more noise is introduced, but a weak
  tendency of negative slopes is found among the tropical cases, as well as in the
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WN\(\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N }\DIFaddend case up to the last season where the noise is also the largest.

  \citeA<>[their Fig.\ 1c,d]{marshall2020} present results that demonstrate a
  time-dependent relationship in the conversion between AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF}\DIFaddend . They obtain an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF
  }\DIFaddend to AOD ratio with a negative slope when comparing the first post-eruption year to the
  second and third. As such, \citeA{marshall2020} find that, on average, the aerosol
  forcing efficiency increases during the first two to three post-eruption years. This
  phenomenon is explained by \citeA{marshall2020} as the aerosols initially being
  spatially confined to the hemisphere where the eruption occurred. Subsequently, during
  the second and third years, they spread globally, resulting in a higher global-mean
  albedo per AOD and consequently a stronger \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend per AOD ratio with time. However, as
  noted above, a decrease in aerosol forcing efficiency is found when analysing the M20
  data with seasonal resolution during the pre-peak period (first year post-eruption)
  while constraining the ensemble to only include eruptions within \(-10\) to
  \(\SI{10}{\degree\mathrm{N}}\). \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \annote[reviewer1]{The post-peak period shows an

  Fig.~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}b.

  We also note that while the aerosol forcing efficiency is decreasing for tropical M20

  \DIFadd{For STrop, }\DIFaddend we observe in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a an almost linear yet notably
  weakening relationship between AOD peak values and injected \ce{SO2}. The latitude
  also plays a role in the magnitude of the AOD perturbation, evident from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WN\(\uparrow\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N}\DIFaddend . This
  weak yet notable latitude dependence aligns with findings by \citeA{marshall2019},
  indicating that \(\SI{72}{\percent}\) of the AOD variance can be attributed to
  injected \ce{SO2}, while latitude accounts for only \(\SI{16}{\percent}\) of the
  variance. Peak values from their data (82 simulations) plotted as red thin diamonds
  display a similar pattern, with AOD exhibiting close to linear dependence on injected
  \ce{SO2}, but with latitude introducing a spread in AOD. Peak values from
  Mt.\ Pinatubo (P) and Mt.\ Tambora (T) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are shown for reference, along with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{align well with simulation data, while }\DIFaddend peak

  aerosols than B20; from an eruption injecting
  \(\SI{2000}{\tera\gram(\mathrm{SO_{2}})}\) E13 find a peak aerosol effective radius of
  \(R_{\mathrm{EFF}}=\SI{1.9}{\micro\meter}\), while B20 obtained
  \(R_{\mathrm{EFF}}=\SI{0.7}{\micro\meter}\) from an eruption injecting half as much

  time it takes for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to reach peak values after an eruption. Combined with their lack

  Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} to peak \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend values (occurring about one year

}\DIFdelend 

  With these caveats in mind, we observe that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{even though most simulations exhibit a
  notably faster increase than the exponential relationship, }\DIFaddend T10's results closely align
  with the function described in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Starting with an
  initial input of \(\SI{850}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})}\) (equivalent to
  \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), representing the YTT eruption), their estimated
  AOD led to a peak \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\), depicted as a pink filled
  circle in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b. The results from T10 came from a
  simulation using the MPI-ESM climate model, driven by AOD data from the HAM aerosol
  model. This alignment likely stems from the utilization of the same aerosol
  microphysical model in both \citeA{timmreck2010} and \citeA{niemeier2015}, as well as
  the application of similar climate models, MPI-ESM and ECHAM5, respectively. The
  relationship between climate model families and their implications are further
  described in Appendix C. Notably, the peak values from M20 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{align with OB16 and }\DIFaddend fit
  well within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an upper
  boundary defined by C2WTrop and OB16, and }\DIFdelend a lower boundary defined by Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Eruptions closer to the equator within M20 align
  with data points near the upper boundary, whereas eruptions at more extreme latitudes
  tend to yield weaker peak RF values, closer to the lower boundary. }\DIFdelend Importantly, none of the eruption simulations shown in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b exceeded the upper threshold of
  \(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\) as suggested in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.

  Figure~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}c illustrates the response of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend against injected
  \ce{SO2}. The increase in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend response with injected \ce{SO2} decreases for higher
  injected \ce{SO2}, showing a similar relationship between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WTrop, C2WN\(\uparrow\), and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop, S1629N, }\DIFaddend OB16\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, B20,

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d, we revisit the relationship between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend and AOD,
  focusing on peak values rather than annual and seasonal averages. As previously
  discussed, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD ratio displays weaker slopes than previous studies, with the
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop }\DIFaddend peak values not conforming to a linear trend. The relationship between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend and
  AOD suggests potential substantial dependencies on the model and its input parameters,
  such as latitude, but most notably to an inherent non-linear \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend dependence on AOD.
  Both the G16 data in Fig.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} and the J05 data originate from
  the same climate model. Similarly to what we find from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop }\DIFaddend data, the ratio is
  much stronger for small eruptions in the industrial era (G16) compared to the
  super-volcano eruption (J05).

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e, we again find that the response of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WTrop
  data
  decreases with injected \ce{SO2}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop data
  increases sublinearly with increasing AOD}\DIFaddend , this time in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend anomaly. Additionally,
  both \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the C2WN\(\uparrow\) and the J05 cases }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N and B20 }\DIFaddend align well with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WTrop, with the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop, with }\DIFaddend T10\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{case

  the one outlier from Os20 stemming from the simulation where feedback on
  photochemistry due to aerosols was switched off.
}\DIFaddend 

  Finally, in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}f, we compare the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature and RF
  responses.

  and RF. The C2WTrop dataindicate a steeper slope }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST and ERF responses.

  STrop closely. J05 is also not far off the STrop data, but still represent a small
  deviation from the other estimates. OB16 also show a linear, yet shallower slope as

  However, potential biases exist in the values from the analysis of OB16, as outlined
  in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:ob16}. This, along with considerable noise, results in
  the analysis of OB16 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend anomalies being less reliable.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e, the C2WN\(\uparrow\) case along

  \subsection{Climate sensitivity estimate}

  As previously mentioned, the J05 experiment is similar to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\) concerning RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629 concerning ERF }\DIFaddend values,
  yet differ in both AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST}\DIFaddend . At the same time J05 is similar to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S3000 }\DIFaddend in AOD and
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF}\DIFaddend . To investigate this discrepancy, we here conduct a comparison between the J05
  climate feedback parameter \(\alpha\) (where \(s=1/\alpha\) is the climate sensitivity
  parameter) with our climate resistance, denoted as \(\rho\), and the transient climate
  response parameter (TCRP) \(1/\rho\) (where \(\mathrm{TCS}=F_{2\times\ce{CO2}}\times
  \mathrm{TCRP}\) is the transient climate sensitivity and \(F_{2\times\ce{CO2}}\) is
  the forcing due to a doubling of pre-industrial \ce{CO2} concentration).
  \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \annote[reviewer1]{As the forcing of volcanic
%DIFDELCMD <     eruptions typically lasts for about a year}{Volcanic forcing definitely lasts for
%DIFDELCMD <     more than a year!}%%%
\DIFdel{, a duration too short }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As the forcing of volcanic eruptions last for too short time
  }\DIFaddend for \(F=\rho T\) to remain valid, an alternative approach using a time-integral form
  introduced by \citeA{merlis2014} is applied:

  \begin{equation}
    \int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t=\rho\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t
    \label{eq:climate-resistance-orig}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \rho=\frac{\int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t}{\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t}.
    \label{eq:climate-resistance}
  \end{equation}

  If the upper bound of the integral, \(\tau\), is sufficiently large, so that the upper
  ocean heat content is the same at \(t=0\) and \(t=\tau\) (\citeA{merlis2014} used
  \(\tau =\SI{15}{\mathrm{yr}}\)), this approach agrees with \(F=\rho T\) for long-term
  forcing \cite{gregory2016}. Additionally, we note that the climate resistance and the
  climate feedback parameter are associated with the ocean heat uptake efficiency
  (\(\kappa\)) through \(\rho =\alpha +\kappa\) \cite{gregory2016}.

  The climate feedback parameter estimated by \citeA{jones2005} is \(\alpha \simeq
  \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), exceeding twice the value obtained by
  \citeA{gregory2016} in their simulations of Mt.\ Pinatubo using the same HadCM3
  climate model. We determine the climate resistance using the integral-form computation
  outlined in Eq.~\ref{eq:climate-resistance} and adopting \(\tau
  =\SI{20}{\mathrm{yr}}\). The estimated climate resistance from the three tropical
  simulation cases (with four in each ensemble) converges to \(\rho
  =\SI{2.5(4)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), and TCRP values of
  \(1/\rho=\SI{0.41(5)}{\kelvin\watt^{-1}\metre^{2}}\), as reported in

  Importantly, our estimate agrees well with G16, while the J05 estimate of \(\alpha

  %DIF <  RF / AOD linearity does not hold for large eruptions
  %DIF >  ERF / AOD linearity does not hold for large eruptions
  Figures~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes},~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}, and
  \ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d demonstrate that as the AOD exceeds approximately \(1.0\),
  the linear \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend dependence of approximately
  \(\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) no longer holds. The sublinear
  increase in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend with injected \ce{SO2} in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b for large
  eruptions is consistent with previous results from simulations using similar climate
  models of smaller historic eruptions (G16) and of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{super-volcanoes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supereruptions }\DIFaddend (J05). Such a change
  in ratio has been attributed to larger eruptions, injecting more \ce{SO2}, leading to
  larger aerosols, and hence less effective radiation scattering, thereby reducing the
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend for the same injected \ce{SO2} \cite{english2013, timmreck2010, timmreck2018}.
  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Similarly, previous studies have suggested a two-thirds power law relationship between
  peek AOD and injected \ce{SO2} for eruptions larger in magnitude than than the Mt.\
  Tambora eruption \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{crowley2013,metzner2014,timmreck2024}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. Furthermore, CESM(WACCM)
  has been shown to simulate smaller aerosols than most other climate models
  \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{clyne2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, resulting in an increased AOD peak value and longer \(e\)-folding
  time \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zanchettin2016,clyne2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. Thus, the sublinear relationship for AOD and ERF
  to injected \ce{SO2} from CESM2(WACCM6) is likely an upper bound.
}\DIFaddend 

  %DIF <  Latitude is more important for the development of the RF / AOD ratio
  %DIF >  Latitude is more important for the development of the ERF / AOD ratio
  The non-linear relationship between peak \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend and AOD values is a strong signature in
  both Figs.~\ref{fig:2_rf_vs_aod_slopes} and~\ref{fig:3_rf_to_aod_ratios}. Across
  eruptions of the same strength, the ratio stays relatively constant, leading to a
  close to \(\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) slope for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(-\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S400 }\DIFaddend and a
  \(\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) slope for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\uparrow\) and C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629 and S3000}\DIFaddend . Still, a
  non-linear development in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD ratio is found across all tropical eruptions.
  Similar to the results of \citeA{marshall2020}, we find in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(-\), C2W\(\uparrow\), and C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S400, S1629, and S3000 }\DIFaddend that
  the post-peak period (second and third post-eruption years) has a stronger aerosol
  forcing efficiency compared to the pre-peak period (first post-eruption year). The
  post-peak period of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W\(\downarrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S26 }\DIFaddend is elevated as compared to the pre-peak period, resulting in a
  decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency from the first to the second and third
  post-eruption years, in contrast to the other tropical eruptions.

  Focusing on the pre-peak period, we find tropical eruptions to differ from eruptions
  at high latitudes. During the pre-peak period, all tropical eruptions show a
  decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency, while no significant change in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD
  ratio is found from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WN\(\uparrow\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N }\DIFaddend case. The full M20 dataset indicates an increasing
  aerosol forcing efficiency also during the pre-peak period, contrasting the decreasing
  efficiency found from their tropical eruptions and supporting the latitudinal
  dependence we find with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WN\(\uparrow\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1629N}\DIFaddend . While we find a linear relationship to be a useful
  approximation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend dependence on AOD for eruptions similar to or smaller than Mt.\
  Pinatubo, additional factors must be considered for larger eruptions. These factors,
  such as \ce{OH} scarcity \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contributing to delayed \ce{SO2} oxidation, }\DIFaddend and aerosol
  growth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, influence }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{influencing }\DIFaddend reflectance and their gravitational pull, substantially \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impacting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{impact }\DIFaddend both
  AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF evolution, is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF evolution, as }\DIFaddend highlighted by \citeA{timmreck2010}. The large difference in
  ratio found when comparing eruption magnitudes suggests that injected \ce{SO2} is
  crucial when estimating the time-average of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD ratio. However, latitude
  and, in particular, aerosol dispersion are more influential in determining the
  post-eruption evolution of the ratio, particularly during the pre-peak period.

  We find that the suggested upper threshold from Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} is
  not violated by any eruption simulation, and most notably that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend peak value
  follow the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend trend in reaching a limiting value. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2WTrop }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop }\DIFaddend cases follow a close to
  linear \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature dependency on RF, with the J05}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST dependency on ERF, with S1629N}\DIFaddend , T10, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and C2WN\(\uparrow\)
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{B20, and McG24 all }\DIFaddend aligning close to
  the same slope. The linear relationship between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature and RF
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST and ERF }\DIFaddend is the strongest
  dependence found between the parameters in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, and a
  strong signature across both eruption magnitudes and latitudes, but also across highly
  different climate models. Thus, from a maximum \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\),
  we expect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend anomalies to reach at most \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(\sim\SI{-12}{\kelvin}\). }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(\sim\SI{-10}{\kelvin}\), in support of
  \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{english2013} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
who suggested that large eruptions can be self-limiting. While J05
  achieve an even stronger cooling, the long \(e\)-folding time of their AOD time series
  is believed to contribute a too strong forcing and climate feedback parameter,
  resulting in an estimated GMST that is too extreme.

  within similar models, even when comparing simulations of volcanic eruptions
  \cite{timmreck2010} and continuous injection of \ce{SO2} \cite{niemeier2015}, but has
  a wide spread at high values of injected \ce{SO2} across model families
  (Figs.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}a,b,c). Comparatively, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF

  }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}d) and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}e) as a
  function of AOD, as well as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend as a function of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF
  }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}f), demonstrate a smaller spread across models.
  \citeA{marshall2019, marshall2020, marshall2021} use a code with seven log-normal
  modes to simulate aerosol mass and number concentrations, along with an
  atmosphere-only configuration of the UM-UKCA with prescribed sea-surface temperatures
  and sea-ice extent \cite{marshall2019}. This approach is in contrast with CESM2,
  operating as an Earth System Model, but with a simpler aerosol chemistry model in the
  MAM3. The family of models to which M20 is based is different from that of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C2W and
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{STrop,
  }\DIFaddend OB16, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and also different from the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{E13, and B20, with }\DIFaddend T10 and N15, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and Os20 and McG24 from yet two more model
  families, }\DIFaddend as described in Appendix C. Based on Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}, we
  find the model family to be pivotal in determining the estimated AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF
  }\DIFaddend magnitudes from injected \ce{SO2}, whereas the various models generally demonstrate
  more consistency in representing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend from AOD.

  %DIF <  AOD time series are different across eruption magnitudes, and peak at later times
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{timmreck2010} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
highlights that for sufficiently large eruptions, \ce{OH}
  radicals are too scarce, which limits \ce{SO2} oxidation. The AOD peak in the YTT
  simulation of T10 occurs six months after Mt.\ Pinatubo's peak. This aligns with our
  results, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_compare_waveform}a, where C2W\(\downarrow\)
  shows an earlier AOD peak compared to C2W\(-\), C2W\(\uparrow\), and
  C2W\(\uparrow\uparrow\). While the peak RF value of T10 occurs \(7\)--\(8\) months
  post-eruption, similar to C2W, the J05 peak anomaly occurs one year post-eruption.
  Additionally, as \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{jones2005} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
obtains a climate feedback parameter larger than
  both what \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{gregory2016} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
found for the same climate model and larger than the
  climate resistance obtained here from C2W, we conclude that such a simple approach of
  scaling the AOD of smaller eruptions to represent larger eruptions is insufficient.
  Moreover, having a small ensemble of large eruptions to represent smaller eruptions is
  also insufficient when simulating from injected \ce{SO2}, as both AOD and temperature
  evolution are found to develop differently.

\DIFdelend \section{Summary and conclusions}

  \label{sec:conclusions}

  We consider five \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{medium to super-volcano sized eruption ensembles }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ensembles of Mt.\ Pinatubo-sized to supereruption sized events }\DIFaddend and
  compare them to previously reported results. We find the commonly adopted \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF
  }\DIFaddend dependence on AOD of \(\sim\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) to be
  representative for Mt.\
  Pinatubo-sized eruptions. Larger eruptions, with one to two orders of magnitude larger
  injections of \ce{SO2}, are found to have an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend dependence on AOD closer to
  \(\sim\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) and
  \(\sim\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\). A shallower slope for larger
  eruptions is also consistent with peak values from previous studies of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{super-volcanoes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supereruptions}\DIFaddend .

  The time-after-eruption dependence of the ratio between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend and AOD is found to weaken
  with time, resulting in a decreasing aerosol forcing efficiency in the pre-peak
  period. The effect is found across all eruption sizes, but only the tropical cases
  show a clear trend. The high-latitude case displays an almost constant efficiency with
  time. These results agree with a reanalysis of the tropical data in
  \citeA{marshall2020dataset}. Thus, these findings provide strong supporting evidence
  that latitude is generally significant in determining the aerosol forcing efficiency,
  particularly as a function of time-after-eruption. These findings emphasise the
  complexity of volcanic impacts on climate, demonstrating significant differences in
  climatic response depending on eruption magnitude and latitude.

  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A clear trend across all simulations performed here and across several previous
  studies is a linear relationship between peek GMST and ERF. Further, the peak values
  seem to stagnate with no ERF peaks breaking the suggested lower bound of
  \(\text{ERF}=\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{niemeier2015}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. Thus, we expect
  supereruptions to be self-limiting with the most extreme GMST perturbations reaching
  at most \(~\sim \SI{-10}{\kelvin}\).
}

  \DIFaddend We find that the AOD peak arrives later for larger eruptions than for smaller ones,
  and also that larger eruptions produce a sharper peak in the AOD time series. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF
  }\DIFaddend time series are similar across all eruption sizes, and while the smallest eruption
  experiences a faster \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend decay, the larger eruptions produce time series
  indistinguishable in development for both \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF and temperature}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF and GMST}\DIFaddend . Thus, a simple scaling of the
  AOD or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend time series from a smaller eruption is insufficient in representing that
  of larger volcanic eruptions.

  Considering injected \ce{SO2} and the peak values of AOD and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF}\DIFaddend , a large spread is
  found across model families in Fig.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}. Improving the
  consistency between model families in how the chemistry and physics of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ce{SO2} and
  \ce{H2SO4} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{aerosols }\DIFaddend are
  represented is an important step in enhancing the accuracy of simulated volcanic
  eruptions' influence on climate by models. More simulations of larger volcanic
  eruptions with injected \ce{SO2} greater than \(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\mathrm{SO2})}\)
  would provide useful information for a more precise determination of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend to AOD
  ratio in the non-linear regime. This would also serve as a useful test to check if a
  comparison between \ce{SO2} injection events and continuous \ce{SO2} injection is
  reasonable. Introducing a spread in latitude similar to the
  \citeA{marshall2020dataset} dataset would allow for better comparison between
  eruptions across all latitudes and the suggested lower limit following
  Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}, describing a situation of aerosol saturation.

  used in their model simulations, along with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF and temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF and GMST }\DIFaddend output data. The injected
  \ce{SO2} can be found at
  \url{https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/paleo/simulations/ccsm4-lm}. Only the
  peak values of the \ce{SO2} dataset were used in the analysis. Output variables are
  available at \url{www2.cesm.ucar.edu/models/experiments/LME}.

  Since the OB16 dataset contains a five-member ensemble, the final \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF and temperature
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF and GMST }\DIFaddend time
  series used were ensemble means. A single control simulation time series is used to
  remove seasonal dependence from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST}\DIFaddend , where the control simulation is averaged
  into a climatology mean. Further, a drift in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend is removed by subtracting a
  linear regression fit. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend has seasonality removed in the Fourier domain.

  The time of an eruption is found based on a best attempt at aligning the \ce{SO2} time
  series with both the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF }\DIFaddend time series and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GMST }\DIFaddend time series. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF and temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF and GMST }\DIFaddend peak
  values are taken as the value of the time series at the time of an eruption according
  to the \ce{SO2} time series. Missing the true peak means the found peaks will be
  biased towards lower values. However, instances where eruptions occur close in time
  will contribute a bias to higher values. These biases contribute to a greater
  uncertainty related to OB16 in Figs.~\ref{fig:4_parameter_scan}b,c,f.

  \subsection{Marshall data analysis}

  \label{ap:m20}

  Data used to compute the M20 values were from \citeA{marshall2020dataset}, available
  at \url{https://doi.org/10.5285/232164e8b1444978a41f2acf8bbbfe91}. As each file
  includes a single eruption, peak values of AOD, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RF, and temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ERF, and GMST }\DIFaddend were found by applying a
  Savitzky-Golay filter of third order and one-year window length, and choosing the
  maximum value \cite{savitzky1964}.

  \subsection{Gregory data analysis}

  \label{ap:g16}

  Data used to compute G16 values were kindly provided by Jonathan Gregory (personal
  communication). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This include a 160-year long simulation with the HadCM3 using the
  sstPiHistVol simulation set-up, specifying a fixed sea-surface temperature simulation
  of historic volcanoes in pre-industrial conditions. }\DIFaddend The full 160-year-long time series
  were further analysed by computing annual means.

  \section{Model families}

  The model used here was the CESM2 with the WACCM6 atmosphere in the MA configuration.
  The MA configuration uses the MAM3 \cite{gettleman2019}, a simplified and
  computationally efficient default setting within the CAM5 \cite{liu2016}, as described
  in \citeA{liu2012}. The MAM3 was developed from MAM7, consisting of the seven modes
  Aitken, accumulation, primary carbon, fine dust, fine sea salt, coarse dust, and
  coarse sea salt. Instantaneous internal mixing of primary carbonaceous aerosols with
  secondary aerosols and instantaneous ageing of primary carbonaceous particles are
  assumed by emitting primary carbon in the accumulation mode \cite{liu2016}. As dust
  absorbs water efficiently and is expected to be removed by wet deposition similarly to
  sea salt, fine dust is merged with fine sea salt into the accumulation mode and coarse
  dust is merged with coarse sea salt into a coarse mode. The coarse mode will quickly
  revert to its background state below the tropopause \cite{liu2012}. Consequently, MAM3
  features the three modes Aitken, accumulation, and coarse \cite{liu2016}.

  The CESM2 is an ancestor of CESM1 used by OB16. They belong to a different model
  family than both the HadCM3 (J05 and G16) and the UM-UKCA (M20), which is an extended
  version of HadGEM3 \cite{dhomse2014}, and an ancestor of HadCM3. A third model family
  is represented through ECHAM5 (N15) and MPI-ESM (T10), where the latter is related to
  the former via the ECHAM6. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Finally, a fourth family is represented through the GISS
  ModelE2.1 used by both Os20 and McG24. }\DIFaddend A summary of the model code genealogy is in
  table~\ref{tab:model-family}, based on the model code genealogy map created by
  \citeA{kuma2023}.
