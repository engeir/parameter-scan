 abstract = {The oxidation of volcanic SO2 to sulphate in the stratosphere is investigated for an anomalously large volcanic sulphur loading (\(\sim\)200 Mt) similar to that generated by the Tambora eruption in 1815. Model calculations suggest that stratospheric OH levels can be severely reduced by the gas-phase oxidation of SO2. One implication of this is that dense volcanic SO2 clouds may last substantially longer than previously thought. SO2 oxidation is also found to lead to significant stratospheric dehydration because approximatively three molecules of H2O are consumed for each molecule of SO2 converted to sulphate. Therefore it is possible to view major volcanic eruptions as a potential sink for stratospheric H2O.},

 abstract = {AbstractSimulations of stratospheric clouds from eruptions ranging in size from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo to that of Toba 74,000 years ago have been completed using a 3D microphysical sectional aerosol model advectively coupled to a general circulation model with prognostic chemistry (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model/Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres). For Pinatubo, properties of the aerosol cloud peak within the ranges derived from observations in the Northern Hemisphere, but reduce faster than observed, and a general low bias is found in the Southern Hemisphere. These biases could be reduced by adding aerosol radiative coupling, a quasi-biennial oscillation, and the Cerro Hudson eruption to the model. Simulations of eruptions 10 times and 100 times larger than Pinatubo suggest burdens and Aerosol Optical Depth increase less than linearly (a 100-fold injection increase produces a 20-fold AOD increase) due to particle growth and sedimentation, consistent with previous work that also found the radiative forcings from large eruptions to be self-limiting. Global-averaged AOD remains elevated for 1, 2, and 4 years, respectively, for the three simulated eruptions. The inclusion of van der Waals forces in our coagulation scheme increases peak effective radius and reduces peak AOD by about 10–20\%, with bigger effects for larger eruptions. Our simulations find peak mode size to vary by up to an order of magnitude and mode width to vary by up to 50\%, suggesting that two-moment modal models may not accurately capture the evolving size distribution. These simulations suggest the value of including van der Waals forces in the coagulation scheme and sectional size distributions in climate models.},

Climatic changes following a hypothetical `super-eruption' are simulated using a coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation model, incorporating scaled volcanic stratospheric aerosols. Assumptions are made about the stratospheric sulphate aerosol loading, size distribution, lifetime, chemical make up and spatial distribution. As this study is concentrating on the physical climatological impacts over long timescales, microphysics and chemical interactive processes are not simulated. Near-surface temperatures fall by as much as 10 K globally for a few months and a considerable deviation from normal temperatures continues for several decades. A warming pattern is evident over northern land masses during the winter due to increased longwave forcing and a positive AO mode. The overturning rate of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation doubles in intensity. Snow and ice increases in extent to a maximum coverage of 35{\%} of the Earth. Despite these and other impacts longer term climatic changes that could lead to a transition to a glaciation do not occur, for present day boundary conditions and one possible plausible aerosol loading.},

@article{metzner2014,
 abstract = {We present for the first time a self-consistent methodology connecting volcanological field data to global climate model estimates for a regional time series of explosive volcanic events. Using the petrologic method, we estimated SO2 emissions from 36 detected Plinian volcanic eruptions occurring at the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) during the past 200,000 years. Together with simple parametrized relationships collected from past studies, we derive estimates of global maximum volcanic aerosol optical depth (AOD) and radiative forcing (RF) describing the effect of each eruption on radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. In parallel, AOD and RF time series for selected CAVA eruptions are simulated with the global aerosol model MAECHAM5-HAM, which shows a relationship between stratospheric SO2 injection and maximum global mean AOD that is linear for smaller volcanic eruptions (<5 Mt SO2) and nonlinear for larger ones (≥5 Mt SO2) and is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the relationship used in the simple parametrized approximation. Potential climate impacts of the selected CAVA eruptions are estimated using an earth system model of intermediate complexity by RF time series derived by (1) directly from the global aerosol model and (2) from the simple parametrized approximation assuming a 12-month exponential decay of global AOD. We find that while the maximum AOD and RF values are consistent between the two methods, their temporal evolutions are significantly different. As a result, simulated global maximum temperature anomalies and the duration of the temperature response depend on which RF time series is used, varying between 2 and 3 K and 60 and 90 years for the largest eruption of the CAVA dataset. Comparing the recurrence time of eruptions, based on the CAVA dataset, with the duration of climate impacts, based on the model results, we conclude that cumulative impacts due to successive eruptions are unlikely. The methodology and results presented here can be used to calculate approximate volcanic forcings and potential climate impacts from sulfur emissions, sulfate aerosol or AOD data for any eruption that injects sulfur into the tropical stratosphere.},

 abstract = {Abstract A simple physical model of the atmospheric effects of large explosive volcanic eruptions is developed. Using only one input parameter—the initial amount of sulphur dioxide injected into the stratosphere—the global-average stratospheric optical-depth perturbation and surface temperature response are modelled. The simplicity of this model avoids issues of incomplete data (applicable to more comprehensive models), making it a powerful and useful tool for atmospheric diagnostics of this climate forcing mechanism. It may also provide a computationally inexpensive and accurate way of introducing volcanic activity into larger climate models. The modelled surface temperature response for an initial sulphur-dioxide injection, coupled with emission-history statistics, is used to demonstrate that the most climatically significant volcanic eruptions are those of sufficient explosivity to just reach into the stratosphere (and achieve longevity). This study also highlights the fact that this measure of significance is highly sensitive to the representation of the climatic response and the frequency data used, and that we are far from producing a definitive history of explosive volcanism for at least the past 1000 years. Given this high degree of uncertainty, these results suggest that eruptions that release around and above 0.1 Mt SO2 into the stratosphere have the maximum climatic impact.

Improved horizontal resolution, dynamics, and chemistry now produce an internally generated quasi-biennial oscillation and significant improvements to stratospheric temperatures and ozone compared to observations. We present a validation of WACCM column ozone and climate calculations against observations. The prognostic treatment of stratospheric sulfate aerosols accurately represents the evolution of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and perturbations to solar and longwave radiation following the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. We confirm the inclusion of interactive OH chemistry as an important factor in the formation and initial distribution of aerosol following large inputs of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the stratosphere. We calculate that depletion of OH levels within the dense SO2 cloud in the first weeks following the Pinatubo eruption significantly prolonged the average initial e-folding decay time for SO2 oxidation to 47 days. Previous observational and model studies showing a 30 day decay time have not accounted for the large (30–55\%) losses of SO2 on ash and ice within 7–9 days posteruption and have not correctly accounted for OH depletion. We examine the variability of aerosol evolution in free-running climate simulations due to meteorology, with comparison to simulations nudged with specified dynamics. We assess calculated impacts of volcanic aerosols on ozone loss with comparisons to observations. The completeness of the chemistry, dynamics, and aerosol microphysics in WACCM qualify it for studies of stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering.},

 abstract = {Abstract Volcanic eruptions are an important climate driver. The impact of Pinatubo-sized eruptions has been observed and is well constrained. The magnitude and duration of volcanic winter effects after supereruptions such as Toba remain disputed due to disagreement between the strong cooling predicted by models and much milder climate perturbations according to the paleodata. Here we present a reevaluated climate impact of a Toba-sized supereruption based on up-to-date GISS ModelE simulations. In this study, we account for all known primary mechanisms that govern the evolution of the volcanic plume and their nonlinear interactions. The SO radiative effects are evaluated for the first time in coupled climate simulations with the interactive atmospheric chemistry module. We found that SO effects on photochemistry, dynamics, and radiative forcing are especially prominent. Due to strong absorption in ultraviolet, SO feedback on photochemistry partially offsets the limiting effect associated with aerosol microphysical processes. SO greenhouse warming soothes the radiative cooling exerted by sulfate aerosols. SO absorption in the shortwave and longwave causes radiative heating and lofting of the volcanic plume, and boosts the efficiency of SO impact on photochemistry. Our analysis shows that SO lifetime and magnitude of effects scale up and increase with the amount of emitted material. For a Pinatubo-sized eruption, SO feedbacks on chemistry and dynamics are relevant only during the initial stage of the volcanic plume evolution, while local SO concentrations are high. For a Toba-sized eruption, SO effects are as important as sulfate aerosols and produce a less extreme volcanic winter.},

 abstract = {We have constructed one-dimensional aerosol microphysical and photochemical models to examine the chemistry of stratospheric volcanic clouds. Estimates of the stratospheric inputs of several key volcanic gases were made. Our results suggest that the aerosol microphysical processes of condensation and coagulation produce larger particles as the SO2 injection rate is increased, rather than a larger number of particles of the same size. Larger particles have a smaller optical depth per unit mass than do smaller ones. They also settle out of the stratosphere at a faster rate, thereby restricting the total number of particles in the stratosphere. These processes moderate the impact of volcanic clouds on the Earth's radiation budget and climate and suggest that volcanic effects may be self-limiting. However, following large eruptions, the scattering of solar radiation by the aerosol and reaction with SO2 can deplete the abundance of OH radicals in the stratosphere. The injection of HCl into the stratosphere, which could lead to large ozone changes, is limited by a cold trap effect in which HCl and water vapor condense on ash particles in the rising volcanic plume and fall out as ice.},

 abstract = {Decreases in surface temperatures after the eruptions of Tambora (1815), Krakatau (1883), and Agung (1963) were of similar magnitude, even though the amount of material (dust and volatiles) injected into the stratosphere by these three events differed greatly. Large amounts of fine ash and volatiles were dispersed into the upper atmosphere by Krakatau and Tambora; the Agung eruption in 1963 was a much smaller, vulcanian-type eruption which injected dust and volatiles into the stratospheric aerosol layer more directly. Analyses of magmatic volatiles indicate that the Agung eruption was proportionately richer in SO2 and Cl than either Tambora or Krakatau. Relative amounts of fine ash produced by the Tambora, Krakatau, and Agung eruptions are estimated at about 150:20:1, whereas the masses of atmospheric sulfate aerosols produced were on the order of 7.5:3:1. Decreases in surface temperature of a few tenths of a degree C for several years following volcanic eruptions are primarily a result of the sulfate aerosols, rather than of the silicate dust. The similarity in the atmospheric response after these three eruptions supports the idea of limiting mechanisms on volcanic stratospheric-aerosol loading, which is suggested by microphysical processes of aerosol particles. Fluctuations in stratospheric aerosol optical depth seem to be controlled to a large degree by high-intensity sulfur-rich eruptions (e.g., Agung, 1963), which may however be relatively small in total ejecta volume. Such eruptions leave little geologic record, but appear as acidity peaks in polar ice cores.},

 abstract = {It has been suggested that the Toba volcanic eruption, approximately 74 ka B.P., was responsible for the extended cooling period and ice sheet advance immediately following it, but previous climate model simulations, using 100 times the amount of aerosols produced by the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, have been unable to produce such a prolonged climate response. Here we conduct six additional climate model simulations with two different climate models, the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model 3.0 (CCSM3.0) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE, in two different versions, to investigate additional mechanisms that may have enhanced and extended the forcing and response from such a large supervolcanic eruption. With CCSM3.0 we include a dynamic vegetation model to explicitly calculate the feedback of vegetation death on surface fluxes in response to the large initial reduction in transmitted light, precipitation, and temperature. With ModelE we explicitly calculate the effects of an eruption on stratospheric water vapor and model stratospheric chemistry feedbacks that might delay the conversion of SO2 into sulfate aerosols and prolong the lifetime and radiative forcing of the stratospheric aerosol cloud. To span the uncertainty in the amount of stratospheric injection of SO2, with CCSM3.0 we used 100 times the Pinatubo injection, and with ModelE we used 33, 100, 300, and 900 times the Pinatubo injection without interactive chemistry, and 300 times Pinatubo with interactive chemistry. Starting from a roughly present-day seasonal cycle of insolation, CO2 concentration, and vegetation, or with 6 ka B.P. conditions for CCSM3.0, none of the runs initiates glaciation. The CCSM3.0 run produced a maximum global cooling of 10 K and ModelE runs produced 8–17 K of cooling within the first years of the simulation, depending on the injection, but in all cases, the climate recovers over a few decades. Nevertheless, the “volcanic winter” following a supervolcano eruption of the size of Toba today would have devastating consequences for humanity and global ecosystems. These simulations support the theory that the Toba eruption indeed may have contributed to a genetic bottleneck.},

 abstract = {A simple method of deducing the probable microphysics of a cloud is developed that uses only information about cloud particle mean size, composition, number density, and atmospheric structure. This analysis is applied to the sulfuric acid clouds of Venus, the water ice and dust clouds of Mars, and the ammonia-water and ammonia ice clouds of Jupiter. The Venus cloud layer most closely resembles smog and haze layers on Earth with no sharp concentration gradients. The cloud microphysics is dominated by coagulation, sedimentation, and turbulent mixing. No precipitation is formed. The water ice clouds on Mars resemble tenuous, nonprecipitating cirrus clouds on Earth. Deposition of condensed water on Mars only occurs from surface fogs or direct condensation on the surface. These fogs can provide a very efficient dust deposition mechanism. The observed settling behavior of the great dust storm of 1971 suggests sedimentation at the surface from a turbulent cloud with coagulation growth of large particles to replace those lost by sedimentation, analogous to the nighttime evolution of submicron tropospheric aerosols on Earth. The ammonia-water and ammonia ice clouds on Jupiter produce precipitation on time scales <104 sec. The vertical structure of all clouds is significantly altered. The activity of the lower ammonia-water cloud has significant effects on the vertical distribution of other gases and aerosols, on the vertical transport of heat, and on the dynamics in this portion of the atmosphere.},

 abstract = {Volcanic eruptions impact climate, subtly and profoundly. The size of an eruption is only loosely correlated with the severity of its climate effects, which can include changes in surface temperature, ozone levels, stratospheric dynamics, precipitation, and ocean circulation. We review the processes—in magma chambers, eruption columns, and the oceans, biosphere, and atmosphere—that mediate the climate response to an eruption. A complex relationship between eruption size, style, duration, and the subsequent severity of the climate response emerges. We advocate for a new, consistent metric, the Volcano-Climate Index, to categorize climate response to eruptions independent of eruption properties and spanning the full range of volcanic activity, from brief explosive eruptions to long-lasting flood basalts. A consistent metric for categorizing the climate response to eruptions that differ in size, style, and duration is critical for establishing the relationshipbetween the severity and the frequency of such responses aiding hazard assessments, and furthering understanding of volcanic impacts on climate on timescales of years to millions of years. ▪ We review the processes driving the rocky relationship between eruption size and climate response and propose a Volcano-Climate Index. ▪ Volcanic eruptions perturb Earth&apos;s climate on a range of timescales, with key open questions regarding how processes in the magmatic system, eruption column, and atmosphere shape the climate response to volcanism. ▪ A Volcano-Climate Index will provide information on the volcano-climate severity-frequency distribution, analogous to earthquake hazards. ▪ Understanding of the frequency of specific levels of volcanic climate effects will aid hazard assessments, planning, and mitigation of societal impacts. },

 abstract = {Extremely large volcanic eruptions have been linked to global climate change, biotic turnover, and, for the Younger Toba Tuff (YTT) eruption 74,000 years ago, near-extinction of modern humans. One of the largest uncertainties of the climate effects involves evolution and growth of aerosol particles. A huge atmospheric concentration of sulfate causes higher collision rates, larger particle sizes, and rapid fall out, which in turn greatly affects radiative feedbacks. We address this key process by incorporating the effects of aerosol microphysical processes into an Earth System Model. The temperature response is shorter (9–10 years) and three times weaker (−3.5 K at maximum globally) than estimated before, although cooling could still have reached −12 K in some midlatitude continental regions after one year. The smaller response, plus its geographic patchiness, suggests that most biota may have escaped threshold extinction pressures from the eruption.},

@article{toohey2019,
 abstract = {Extratropical volcanic eruptions are commonly thought to be less effective at driving large-scale surface cooling than tropical eruptions. However, recent minor extratropical eruptions have produced a measurable climate impact, and proxy records suggest that the most extreme Northern Hemisphere cold period of the Common Era was initiated by an extratropical eruption in 536{ \thinspace}ce. Using ice-core-derived volcanic stratospheric sulfur injections and Northern Hemisphere summer temperature reconstructions from tree rings, we show here that in proportion to their estimated stratospheric sulfur injection, extratropical explosive eruptions since 750{\thinspace}ce have produced stronger hemispheric cooling than tropical eruptions. Stratospheric aerosol simulations demonstrate that for eruptions with a sulfur injection magnitude and height equal to that of the 1991{\thinspace}Mount Pinatubo eruption, extratropical eruptions produce time-integrated radiative forcing anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics up to 80{\%} greater than tropical eruptions, as decreases in aerosol lifetime are overwhelmed by the enhanced radiative impact associated with the relative confinement of aerosol to a single hemisphere. The model results are consistent with the temperature reconstructions, and elucidate how the radiative forcing produced by extratropical eruptions is strongly dependent on the eruption season and sulfur injection height within the stratosphere.},

@article{vandijk2024,
 abstract = {Understanding climate variability across interannual to centennial timescales is critical, as it encompasses the natural range of climate fluctuations that early human agricultural societies had to adapt to. Deviations from the long-term mean climate are often associated with both societal collapse and periods of prosperity and expansion. Here, we show that contrary to what global paleoproxy reconstructions suggest, the mid to late-Holocene was not a period of climate stability. We use mid- to late-Holocene Earth System Model simulations, forced by state-of-the-art reconstructions of external climate forcing to show that eleven long-lasting cold periods occurred in the Northern Hemisphere during the past 8000 years. These periods correlate with enhanced volcanic activity, where the clustering of volcanic eruptions induced a prolonged cooling effect through gradual ocean-sea ice feedback. These findings challenge the prevailing notion of the Holocene as a period characterized by climate stability, as portrayed in multi-proxy climate reconstructions. Instead, our simulations provide an improved representation of amplitude and timing of temperature variations on sub-centennial timescales.},
