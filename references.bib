                response of 20th century global mean temperature to volcanic
                forcing. An upwelling diffusion energy balance model (UD EBM)
                with the same forcing and the same climate sensitivity as the
                AOGCM is then used to emulate the AOGCM results. The UD EBM and

                the UD EBM to determine the volcanic response for different
                climate sensitivities. The maximum cooling for any given eruption
                is shown to depend approximately on the climate sensitivity

                many climate forcing agents for producing climate change. We find
                a substantial range in the “efficacy” of different forcings,
                where the efficacy is the global temperature response per unit
                forcing relative to the response to CO2 forcing. Anthropogenic
                CH4 has efficacy ∼110\%, which increases to ∼145\% when its
                indirect effects on stratospheric H2O and tropospheric O3 are
                included, yielding an effective climate forcing of ∼0.8 W/m2 for
                the period 1750–2000 and making CH4 the largest anthropogenic
                climate forcing other than CO2. Black carbon (BC) aerosols from
                biomass burning have a calculated efficacy ∼58\%, while fossil
                fuel BC has an efficacy ∼78\%. Accounting for forcing efficacies
                and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we
                find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (organic carbon),
                has a net positive forcing while biomass burning BC + OC has a
                negative forcing. We show that replacement of the traditional
                instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with an easily
                computed alternative, Fs, yields a better predictor of climate
                change, i.e., its efficacies are closer to unity. Fs is inferred
                from flux and temperature changes in a fixed-ocean model run.
                There is remarkable congruence in the spatial distribution of
                climate change, normalized to the same forcing Fs, for most
                climate forcing agents, suggesting that the global forcing has
                more relevance to regional climate change than may have been
                anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases intensify the Hadley
                circulation in our model, increasing rainfall in the
                Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and
                East Asia, while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics
                including the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region,
                the Middle East, and an expanding Sahel. These features survive
                in model simulations that use all estimated forcings for the
                period 1880–2000. Responses to localized forcings, such as land
                use change and heavy regional concentrations of BC aerosols,
                include more specific regional characteristics. We suggest that
                anthropogenic tropospheric O3 and the BC snow albedo effect
                contribute substantially to rapid warming and sea ice loss in the
                Arctic. As a complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and
                Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing, Fe, which is
                the product of the forcing and its efficacy. Fe requires
                calculation of the climate response and introduces greater model
                dependence, but once it is calculated for a given amount of a
                forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the response to
                other forcing amounts.",

                investigate the validity of high climate sensitivities. The
                higher-sensitivity version, with climate sensitivity of 6.3 K for
                doubled CO2 forcing, overestimates cooling due to the volcanic
                eruption, whereas the lower-sensitivity version (4.0 K) produces

                perfect model study. Two modern climate models (the CCCma CGCM3
                and the NCAR CCSM2) with different equilibrium climate
                sensitivities are employed in the investigation. The models are
                perturbed with the same transient volcano-like forcing and the
                responses analysed to infer climate sensitivities. For
                volcano-like forcing the global mean surface temperature
                responses of the two models are very similar, despite their
                differing equilibrium climate sensitivities, indicating that
                climate sensitivity cannot be inferred from the temperature
                record alone even if the forcing is known. Equilibrium climate
                sensitivities can be reasonably determined only if both the
                forcing and the change in heat storage in the system are known
                very accurately. The geographic patterns of clear-sky
                atmosphere/surface and cloud feedbacks are similar for both the
                transient volcano-like and near-equilibrium constant forcing
                simulations showing that, to a considerable extent, the same
                feedback processes are invoked, and determine the climate
                sensitivity, in both cases. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag

                indicate that the models overestimate the magnitude of the global

                this overestimation can be explained as a sampling issue, arising
                because all large eruptions since 1951 coincided with El Niño
                events, which cause global-scale warming that partially
                counteracts the volcanically induced cooling. By subsampling the
                CMIP5 models according to the observed El Niño–Southern
                Oscillation (ENSO) phase during each eruption, we find that the

                consistent with observations. Volcanic eruptions pose a
                particular challenge for the detection and attribution
                methodology, as their surface impacts are short-lived and hence
                can be confounded by ENSO. Our results imply that detection and

                stratospheric aerosol using an updated version of the Whole
                Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). Improved horizontal
                resolution, dynamics, and chemistry now produce an internally
                generated quasi-biennial oscillation and significant improvements
                to stratospheric temperatures and ozone compared to observations.
                We present a validation of WACCM column ozone and climate
                calculations against observations. The prognostic treatment of
                stratospheric sulfate aerosols accurately represents the
                evolution of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and
                perturbations to solar and longwave radiation following the June
                1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. We confirm the inclusion of
                interactive OH chemistry as an important factor in the formation
                and initial distribution of aerosol following large inputs of
                sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the stratosphere. We calculate that
                depletion of OH levels within the dense SO2 cloud in the first
                weeks following the Pinatubo eruption significantly prolonged the
                average initial e-folding decay time for SO2 oxidation to 47
                days. Previous observational and model studies showing a 30 day
                decay time have not accounted for the large (30–55\%) losses of
                SO2 on ash and ice within 7–9 days posteruption and have not
                correctly accounted for OH depletion. We examine the variability
                of aerosol evolution in free-running climate simulations due to
                meteorology, with comparison to simulations nudged with specified
                dynamics. We assess calculated impacts of volcanic aerosols on
                ozone loss with comparisons to observations. The completeness of
                the chemistry, dynamics, and aerosol microphysics in WACCM

    abstract = "Abstract The radiative forcing caused by a volcanic eruption is
                dependent on several eruption source parameters such as the mass
                of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted, the eruption column height, and
                the eruption latitude. General circulation models with prognostic
                aerosol and chemistry schemes can be used to investigate how each
                parameter influences the volcanic forcing. However, the range of
                multidimensional parameter space that can be explored is
                restricted because such simulations are computationally
                expensive. Here we use statistical emulation to explore the
                radiative impact of eruptions over a wide covarying range of SO2
                emission magnitudes, injection heights, and eruption latitudes
                based on only 30 simulations. We use the emulators to build
                response surfaces to visualize and predict the sulfate aerosol
                e-folding decay time, the stratospheric aerosol optical depth,
                and net radiative forcing of thousands of different eruptions. We
                find that the volcanic stratospheric aerosol optical depth and
                net radiative forcing are primarily determined by the mass of SO2
                emitted, but eruption latitude is the most important parameter in
                determining the sulfate aerosol e-folding decay time. The
                response surfaces reveal joint effects of the eruption source
                parameters in influencing the net radiative forcing, such as a
                stronger influence of injection height for tropical eruptions
                than high-latitude eruptions. We also demonstrate how the
                emulated response surfaces can be used to find all combinations
                of eruption source parameters that produce a particular volcanic
                response, often revealing multiple solutions.",

                forcing, and those to Santa Maria and Agung, which had
                meridionally asymmetric forcing. Although Pinatubo had larger
                global-mean forcing, asymmetric forcing strongly shifts the
                latitude of tropical rainfall features, leading to larger local
                precipitation/tropical cyclone changes. For example, North
                Atlantic tropical cyclone activity over is enhanced/reduced by SH
                forcing (Agung)/NH forcing (Santa Maria) but changes little in
                response to the Pinatubo forcing. Moreover, the transient climate
                sensitivity estimated from the response to Santa Maria is 20\%
                larger than that from Pinatubo or Agung. This spread in climatic
                impacts of volcanoes needs to be considered when evaluating the
                role of volcanoes in global and regional climate and serves to
                contextualize the well-observed response to Pinatubo.",

                of different climate driver efficacies using simulations from the
                Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project
                (PDRMIP). Efficacies calculated from instantaneous radiative
                forcing deviate considerably from unity across forcing agents and
                models. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is a better predictor
                of global mean near-surface air temperature (GSAT) change.
                Efficacies are closest to one when ERF is computed using fixed
                sea surface temperature experiments and adjusted for land surface
                temperature changes using radiative kernels. Multimodel mean
                efficacies based on ERF are close to one for global perturbations
                of methane, sulfate, black carbon, and insolation, but there is
                notable intermodel spread. We do not find robust evidence that
                the geographic location of sulfate aerosol affects its efficacy.
                GSAT is found to respond more slowly to aerosol forcing than CO2
                in the early stages of simulations. Despite these differences, we
                find that there is no evidence for an efficacy effect on
                historical GSAT trend estimates based on simulations with an
                impulse response model, nor on the resulting estimates of climate
                sensitivity derived from the historical period. However, the
                considerable intermodel spread in the computed efficacies means
                that we cannot rule out an efficacy-induced bias of ±0.4 K in
                equilibrium climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling when estimated
                using the historical GSAT trend.",

                (CESM2) is provided, including a discussion of the challenges
                encountered during its development and how they were addressed.
                In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial
                control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These
                simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal
                resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the
                “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km,
                with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric
                component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and
                infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its
                previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical
                simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations.
                These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and
                shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the
                Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Niño-Southern
                Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon
                accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based
                estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and
                high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these
                improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an
                equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in
                CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes
                to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast,
                CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to
                that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other
                simulations are available to the research community, and they
                represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model

                {2}\) doubling is a large source of uncertainty in projections of
                future anthropogenic climate change. Estimates of ECS made from
                non-equilibrium states or in response to radiative forcings other
                than \(\hbox {2}\times \hbox {CO}_{2}\) are called “effective
                climate sensitivity” (EffCS, in K). Taking a “perfect-model”
                approach, using coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation
                model (AOGCM) experiments, we evaluate the accuracy with which \(
                \hbox {CO}_{2}\) EffCS can be estimated from climate change in
                the “historical” period (since about 1860). We find that (1) for
                statistical reasons, unforced variability makes the estimate of
                historical EffCS both uncertain and biased; it is overestimated
                by about 10% if the energy balance is applied to the entire
                historical period, 20% for 30-year periods, and larger factors
                for interannual variability, (2) systematic uncertainty in
                historical radiative forcing translates into an uncertainty of \(
                {\pm }\,30\, {\rm to} \,45\%\) (standard deviation) in historical
                EffCS, (3) the response to the changing relative importance of
                the forcing agents, principally \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) and volcanic
                aerosol, causes historical EffCS to vary over multidecadal
                timescales by a factor of two. In recent decades it reached its
                maximum in the AOGCM historical experiment (similar to the
                multimodel-mean \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) EffCS of 3.6 K from idealised
                experiments), but its minimum in the real world (1.6 K for an
                observational estimate for 1985–2011, similar to the
                multimodel-mean value for volcanic forcing). The real-world
                variations mean that historical EffCS underestimates \(\hbox {CO}
                _{2}\) EffCS by 30% when considering the entire historical
                period. The difference for recent decades implies that either
                unforced variability or the response to volcanic forcing causes a
                much stronger regional pattern of sea surface temperature change
                in the real world than in AOGCMs. We speculate that this could be
                explained by a deficiency in simulated coupled atmosphere–ocean
                feedbacks which reinforce the pattern (resembling the
                Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in some respects) that causes
                the low EffCS. We conclude that energy-balance estimates of \(
                \hbox {CO}_{2}\) EffCS are most accurate from periods unaffected
                by volcanic forcing. Atmosphere GCMs provided with observed sea
                surface temperature for the 1920s to the 1950s, which was such a
                period, give a range of about 2.0–4.5 K, agreeing with idealised
                \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) AOGCM experiments; the consistency is a reason
                for confidence in this range as an estimate of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\)
                EffCS. Unless another explosive volcanic eruption occurs, the
                first 30 years of the present century may give a more accurate
                energy-balance historical estimate of this quantity.",

                from sulfate concentrations measured in polar ice cores, mainly
                using a relationship between the average ice-sheet sulfate
                deposition and stratospheric sulfate aerosol burden based on a
                single explosive eruption—the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Here
                we estimate volcanic radiative forcings and associated
                uncertainty ranges from ice-core sulfate records of eight of the
                largest bipolar deposition signals in the last 2,500 years using
                statistical emulation of a perturbed parameter ensemble of
                aerosol-climate model simulations of explosive eruptions.
                Extensive sampling of different combinations of eruption source
                parameters using the emulators reveals that a very wide range of
                eruptions in different seasons with different sulfur dioxide

                ice-sheet sulfate deposition consistent with ice-core records.

                can be directly attributed to the unknown eruption source
                parameters. We estimate that the uncertainty in volcanic forcing

                uncertainties in the global mean surface cooling of around 1°C

                climate response to contemporary volcanic eruptions. While the

                improved satellite measurements and observations enabling the
                effects of small-magnitude eruptions to be quantified, new proxy
                reconstructions used to investigate the impact of past eruptions,
                and state-of-the-art aerosol-climate modelling that has led to
                new insights on how volcanic eruptions affect the climate.
                Looking to the future, knowledge gaps include the role of
                co-emissions in volcanic plumes, the impact of eruptions on
                tropical hydroclimate and Northern Hemisphere winter climate, and
                the role of eruptions in long-term climate change. Future model
                development, dedicated model intercomparison projects,
                interdisciplinary collaborations, and the application of advanced
                statistical techniques will facilitate more complex and detailed
                studies. Ensuring that the next large-magnitude explosive
                eruption is well observed will be critical in providing
                invaluable observations that will bridge remaining gaps in our
                understanding.",

                on the North Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperature (SST) during
                the last millennium based on both model simulations and
                reconstructions. Our focus is on the two types of relations
                between the states of SST and associated climate variables before
                and after the eruption: modulating and resetting. Here,
                modulating means that the posterior conditions depend on the
                initial SST and the volcano-induced cooling is linearly
                superimposed on the initial SST phases, while resetting means
                that the posterior conditions are independent from the initial
                condition. Our analysis demonstrates that equatorial and northern
                volcanic eruptions larger than 30 Tg could reset NA SST, and
                there is a limitation of SST decrease after eruption, indicating
                the largest SST decrease does not exceed a certain value. While
                equatorial volcanic eruptions larger than 100 Tg and northern
                volcanic eruptions larger than 30 Tg can reset subsurface
                temperature changes. In contrast, even the largest volcanic
                eruption during the last millennium cannot reset the Atlantic
                Meridional Overturning Circulation.",

                Project phase 6 models were used to assess the climate feedback
                parameter for net historical, historical greenhouse gas (GHG) and
                anthropogenic aerosol forcings. The net radiative feedback is
                found to be more amplifying (higher effective climate
                sensitivity) for aerosol than GHG forcing, and hence also less
                amplifying for net historical (GHG + aerosol) than GHG only. We
                demonstrate that this difference is consistent with their
                different latitudinal distributions. Historical aerosol forcing
                is most pronounced in northern extratropics, where the boundary
                layer is decoupled from the free troposphere, so the consequent
                temperature change is confined to low altitude and causes
                low-level cloud changes. This is caused by change in stability,
                which also affects upper-tropospheric clear-sky emission,
                affecting both shortwave and longwave radiative feedbacks. This
                response is a feature of extratropical forcing generally,
                regardless of its sign or hemisphere.",
