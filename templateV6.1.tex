\abstract{%
We investigate the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions spanning from medium-size
events, such as Mt.\ Pinatubo still having a global impact, to super-volcanoes. The
study is based on ensemble simulations in the \gls{cesm2} climate model using the
\gls{waccm} atmosphere model. Here we focus on the dependence of the climate response to
the magnitude of the volcanic eruption. Our analysis centres on the impact of injections
of different magnitudes of \ce{SO2} on \gls{aod}, \gls{rf}, and global temperature
anomalies. Unlike the traditional linear models used for smaller eruptions, our
results reveal a non-linear relationship between \gls{rf} and \gls{aod} for larger
eruptions. We also uncover a notable time-dependent decrease in post-eruption aerosol
forcing efficiency across all eruption magnitudes. In addition, the study reveals that
larger volcanic events produce a delayed and sharper peak in \gls{aod}, alongside a
similar development of the \gls{rf} and temperature time series. These findings
emphasise the complexity of volcanic impacts on climate, demonstrating significant
differences in climatic response depending on eruption magnitude.

% NOTE: what to include in the paper, key questions.
% The paper should provide insight about what might happen if a large volcano erupted
% (order of magnitude or more than Mt.\ Pinatubo). How does the atmosphere react, for
% example in the aerosol dynamics? (QBO, SO2/AOD/RF relationship.) It should also be
% about how volcanic simulations compare in magnitude and if there is time for more
% simulations, how model complexity (dynamic ocean against slab ocean) affect things.
% - How far does the linear relation between AOD and RF go? What phases does the
%   aerosols go though? (Perhaps the most promising avenue.)
% - How much does it matter how high in the atmosphere the initial SO2 is injected?
%   (Already is some literature on this, suggesting it is not much. Also some on
%   latitude dependence, which has a bigger influence.)
% - How does the climate response change based on the state of the climate: what if we
%   run a CO2 doubling or quadrupling simulation until close to equilibrium, and let the
%   volcanoes erupt then? (Lack the doubling scenario, and setting it up has resulted in
%   strange output that must be resolved. Could take a while.)

\Gls{rf} and \gls{aod} are crucial metrics representing the energy imbalance at
\gls{toa} and the stratospheric opacity due to aerosol scattering. They are extensively
used to quantify the impact of major volcanic eruptions, respectively. The assumption of
a linear dependency of \gls{rf} on \gls{aod} is commonly adopted
\citep{myhre2013,andersson2015}, and applying such a linear relationship have yielded
reasonably accurate estimates in climate model simulations of volcanic eruptions
\citep{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Yet, there is a wide
spread in the estimated aerosol forcing efficiencies (\gls{rf} normalised by \gls{aod})
among studies, spanning approximately from \(\sim
\SI{15}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{pitari2016b} to \(\sim
\SI{25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{myhre2013}. Additionally, these
estimates are predominantly based on small volcanoes with \gls{aod} values up to at most
\(\sim 0.7\).

Although \ce{H2O}, \ce{N2} and \ce{CO2} are the most abundant gases emitted by volcanoes
\citep{robock2000}, sulphur species such as \ce{SO2} provide greater influence due to
the comparatively high background concentrations of the former gases in the atmosphere.
The transformation of \ce{SO2} molecules through reactions with \ce{OH} and \ce{H2O}
leads to the formation of sulphate acid (\ce{H2SO4}) \citep{robock2000}, which scatter
sunlight hereby elevating planetary albedo and reducing the \gls{rf}. As the conversion
from \ce{SO2} to \ce{H2SO4} occurs over weeks \citep{robock2000}, the peak \gls{rf}
experiences a slight delay from the eruption's peak \ce{SO2} injection. The lifetime of
the \ce{H2SO4} aerosols in the stratosphere depends on various factors, including
latitude \citep{marshall2019, toohey2019}, volcanic plume height \citep{marshall2019},
aerosol size \citep{marshall2019}, the quasi-biennial oscillation phase
\citep{pitari2016b} and the season of the year (determining to which hemisphere aerosols
are transported) \citep{toohey2011,toohey2019}. In the case of tropical eruptions,
aerosols are typically transported poleward in the stratosphere and descend back to
mid-latitude troposphere within one to two years \citep{robock2000}. Upon descending
below the tropopause, these aerosols are readily removed by wet deposition
\citep{liu2012}.

Before the current era of significant anthropogenic climate forcing, volcanic eruptions
were the primary forcing mechanism dictating Earth's climate variability during the
Holocene period \citep{sigl2022}. Despite this substantial impact, few climate-model
experiments have included volcanic forcing when simulating climate evolution during the
Holocene \citep{sigl2022}, likely implying an exaggerated positive forcing
\citep{gregory2016,solomon2011}. This absence of persistent cooling is one of several
factors that have been suggested to contribute to the common disparity between simulated
and observed global warming \citep{andersson2015}. Despite extensive attention on
understanding the way volcanic eruptions influence climate, questions regarding aerosol
particle processes --- such as growth and creation rates when \ce{OH} is scarce ---
remain unanswered \citep[e.g.,][]{robock2000,zanchettin2019,marshall2020,marshall2022}.
These processes impact aerosol scattering efficiency and potentially the \gls{rf} to
\gls{aod} relationship. \citet{marshall2020} observed higher aerosol forcing efficiency
in post-eruption years \(2\) and \(3\) compared to year 1, and attributing this
post-eruption increase in forcing efficiency to strong spatial concentration in the
initial year and subsequent distribution of aerosols over a larger area. This spatial
redistribution increases the albedo per global mean \gls{aod} hereby causing a stronger
\gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio \citep{marshall2020}.

Previous studies of both Mt.\ Pinatubo \citep{mills2017,hansen2005} and volcanoes within
the instrumental era \citep{gregory2016} have been used to estimate the relationship
between the \gls{rf} energy imbalance and change in \gls{aod} caused by volcanic
eruptions. While \citet{myhre2013} employ a formula scaling \gls{rf} by \gls{aod} to
obtain \(\SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\), recent literature reports
estimates down to \(\SI{-19.0(5)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\)
\citep{gregory2016} and \(\SI{-18.3(10)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\)
\citep{mills2017}. Synthetic volcano simulations in \citet{marshall2020} yield a scaling
factor of \(\SI{-20.5(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) across an ensemble of
\(82\) simulations featuring varying injection heights and latitudes of volcanic
emissions, with \iso{} ranging from \(10\) to \(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

An in-some-way similar simulation setup, albeit with notable differences, was conducted
by \citet{niemeier2015}, involving an ensemble of \(14\) levels of injected sulphur
spanning between \(\SI{1}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) and
\(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)). These geoengineering simulations
maintained continuous sulphur injections, running until a steady sulphur level was
achieved. Results indicated an inverse exponential relationship between \gls{rf} and
\iso{} rate, converging to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\)
(Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}). However, even the \(100\times\) Mt.\ Pinatubo
super-volcano simulation by \citet{jones2005}, who obtained a peak \gls{rf} of
\(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\), is below the suggested limit of
\(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\). Moreover, \citet{timmreck2010} find a peak \gls{rf}
anomaly of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) from a \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\)
eruption simulation, which corresponds well with the function estimated by
\citet{niemeier2015} at the given \ce{SO2} level.

One avenue that has garnered considerable attention is comparing the magnitude of
volcanic or volcano-like forcings to increased \ce{CO2} levels. Several studies explore
the connection between volcanic forcing and the climate sensitivity to a doubling of
\ce{CO2}
\citep{boer2007,marvel2016,merlis2014,ollila2016,richardson2019,salvi2022,wigley2005}.
This comparison aims to mitigate the large uncertainty in estimates of the sensitivity
of the real climate system. Inferring climate sensitivity from volcanic events has been
attempted as a way to constrain the sensitivity \citep{boer2007}, assuming that volcanic
and \ce{CO2} forcings produce similar feedbacks \citep{pauling2023}. Earlier studies
suggest the potential for constraining \gls{ecs} using volcanoes \citep{bender2010},
provided that \gls{ecs} is constrained by \gls{erf} rather than \gls{irf}, as \gls{erf}
accounts for rapid atmospheric adjustments in contrast to \gls{irf}
\citep{richardson2019}. However, other studies refute this approach, pointing out that
different sensitivities of volcanic forcing and \ce{CO2} doubling seem to exist
\citep{douglass2006}, or that constraining the \gls{ecs} by \gls{erf} lacks accuracy due
to the precision of climate simulations \citep{boer2007,salvi2022}. Although \gls{erf}
offers a more suitable indicator of forcing than \gls{irf}
\citep{marvel2016,richardson2019}, more recent studies conclude that \gls{ecs} cannot be
constrained from volcanic events \citep{pauling2023}.

Several studies have demonstrated a linear relationship of approximately
\(-\SI{20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) between \gls{rf} and \gls{aod}, although
substantial variability exists in the slope among studies
\citep{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Moreover, a
time-after-eruption dependence on the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio is found in
\citet{marshall2020}, whereas \citet{niemeier2015} revealed a non-linear relationship
between \gls{rf} and \iso{}. Thus, a consensus on the relationship between \iso{},
\gls{aod} and \gls{rf} has yet to be established.

To address these issues, we conducted ensemble simulations of volcanic eruptions in the
\gls{cesm2} coupled with the \gls{waccm}. The ensembles span \iso{} levels of three
orders of magnitude with four members for each: \(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\),
\(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) and \(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\). Details
regarding the experimental setup are provided in section~\ref{sec:method}. Our findings
reveal clear non-linear \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} dependencies for medium to super-volcano
size eruptions. Additionally, we observe a time-dependent variation in the \gls{rf} to
\gls{aod} ratio, detailed in section~\ref{sec:results} and discussed in
section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Furthermore, our data, along with insights from previous
studies, suggest that the \gls{rf} dependency on \iso{} identified by
\citet{niemeier2015} acts as a lower boundary. Our conclusions are presented in
section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Model}

We utilised the \gls{cesm2} \citep{danabasoglu2020} in conjunction with the \gls{waccm}
\citep{gettleman2019} and the fully dynamical ocean component \gls{pop}
\citep{smith2010, danabasoglu2020}. The atmosphere model was run at nominal
\(\SI{2}{\degree}\) resolution with \(70\) vertical levels in the \gls{ma}
configuration.

The \gls{waccm} version employed in the \gls{ma} configuration uses the \gls{mam3}
\citep{gettleman2019}, a simplified and computationally efficient default setting within
the \gls{cam5} \citep{liu2016}, as described in \citet{liu2012}. The \gls{mam3} was
developed from MAM7, consisting of the seven modes Aitken, accumulation, primary carbon,
fine dust, fine sea salt, coarse dust and coarse sea salt. Instantaneous internal mixing
of primary carbonaceous aerosols with secondary aerosols and instantaneous ageing of
primary carbonaceous particles is assumed by emitting primary carbon in the accumulation
mode \citep{liu2016}. Fine sea salt is assimilated into the accumulation mode, and as
dust absorbs water efficiently, aerosols are expected to be removed by wet deposition
similarly to sea salt, allowing fine dust to be merged into the accumulation mode as
well. Likewise, coarse dust is merged with coarse sea salt into a coarse mode, and as
both absorb water efficiently, the coarse mode will quickly retain its background state
below the tropopause \citep{liu2012}. Consequently, \gls{mam3} features the three modes
Aitken, accumulation and coarse \citep{liu2016}.

\subsection{Simulations}

Appendix A provides a detailed description of the simulation setup and utilised output
variables. Table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} summarizes the simulations, encompassing
three \ce{SO2} injection magnitudes across four seasons: February 15th, May 15th, August
15th, and November 15th. The magnitudes vary over three orders of magnitude:
\(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), and
\(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

The smallest eruption case, \gls{c2wm}, is similar in magnitude as compared to events
like Mt.\ Pinatubo
\citep[\(\sim10\)--\(\SI{20}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);][]{timmreck2018} and Mt.\ Tambora
\citep[\(\sim\SI{56.2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);][]{zanchettin2016}. The intermediate
case, \gls{c2wmp}, resembles the Samalas eruption in 1257
\citep[\(\sim{118.8}\)--\(\SI{173.1}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);][]{toohey2017,ottobliesner2016},
while the largest eruption case, \gls{c2ws}, is similar to the \gls{ytt} eruption
occurring about \(\SI{75000}{\mathrm{yr}}\) ago
\citep[\(100\)--\(\SI{10000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);][]{jones2005}. All eruptions were
situated at the equator (\(\SI{0}{\degree N}\), \(\SI{1}{\degree E}\)) with \ce{SO2}
injected between \(\SI{18}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{20}{\kilo\meter}\) altitude.
Collectively, the three eruption cases \gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} are
referred to as \gls{c2w}. Two additional high-latitude eruptions, labelled \gls{c2wsn},
of the same \iso{} magnitude as \gls{c2ws} were simulated at \(\SI{56}{\degree N}\),
\(\SI{287.7}{\degree E}\) with a six-month separation (February 15th and August 15th).

% FIX: this should be a more clear motivation for/against the use of AOD time series to
% initialise eruption simulations of AOD time series to initialise eruption simulations
Employing eruptions in the medium to super-volcano size enhances the signal-to-noise
ratio without necessitating an extensive and computationally expensive ensemble.
However, the forcing values obtained from the climate model simulations may not be
realistic, or more specifically, be an inappropriate representation of smaller eruptions
typical of the instrumental era \citep{gregory2016}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

% NOTE: the results should be laid out in a logical way, with the most
% interesting/important stuff first, then tangents that dig deeper at specific things
% later.
% 1. RF to AOD time-after-eruption dependence should be top priority (8 figs atm.)
% 2. Then probably temperature scaling since we discuss the shape of both AOD and RF
%    time series before that (MOTIVATION: can we expect a specific temperature time
%    series shape based on the shape of either of or both of the RF and AOD time
%    series?)
% 3. If there is something interesting to say about the rest of the figures (all the
%    comparing of parameters), then this should come here.

\subsection{Analysis of the time series}

Figure~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp} illustrates time series of global mean \gls{aod},
\gls{rf}, and surface air temperature. The black lines represent the medians across the
four-member ensembles, while shading indicates the 5th to 95th percentiles. Three
distinct forcing magnitudes (\gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp}, and \gls{c2ws}), outlined in
table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}, have been used. The time series in
Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp} are normalised by setting the peak value to unity,
defined based on the peak of a fit utilising a Savitzky-Golay filter of 3rd order and a
one-year window length \citep{savitzky1964}.

A notable feature across all three subfigures of Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp} is
the earlier peak occurrence of the \gls{c2wm} case compared to the larger eruption
cases. Cases \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} peak at similar times, but \gls{c2wmp} exhibits
a faster rise and slower decay in the \gls{aod} time series
(Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}a). Generally, the \gls{aod} time series from
stronger eruption cases seem to display a sharper peak, or a slower rise and faster
decay. The rise across the three eruption cases in Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b
is similar, although \gls{c2wm} reaches the peak just prior to the other two cases.
During the decay phase, all cases appear to decay at a similar rate, however maintaining
the offset caused by the earlier peak arrival of \gls{c2wm}. Cases \gls{c2wmp} and
\gls{c2ws} exhibit indistinguishable \gls{rf} time series. Similarly, when observing the
temperature evolution in Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}c, \gls{c2wmp} and
\gls{c2ws} are indistinguishable, while \gls{c2wm} has a sharper peak relative to the
two other cases. Nevertheless, across all cases for the parameters shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}, a similar temporal development is found.
Therefore, similar dynamics are expected to be at play in all cases.

\begin{figure}

    three tropical volcanic eruption cases, \gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws}. The time
    series have been normalised to have peak values at unity, where \(C\) is the
    normalisation constant. Black lines indicate the median across the four-member
    ensembles, while shading marks the 5th and 95th
    percentiles.}\label{fig:compare-waveform-temp}%
\end{figure}

Upon asking whether the shape of the temperature time series can be inferred from the
shape of either of the forcing time series (\gls{aod} or \gls{rf}), we find that the
shapes of the \gls{rf} time series are consistent over the different eruption strengths
(Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b), suggesting a strong dependence of temperature
on \gls{rf}. About the same can largely be said about the \gls{aod} time series, though
they show a slight change in shape from smaller to larger eruptions
(Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}a). Specifically, the \gls{aod} time series from
smaller eruptions displays a fast rise and a flat peak before decaying back to its
equilibrium state. From the larger eruptions, we find a slower rise but a sharper peak,
resulting in a decay to equilibrium happening at a similar time after the eruption and
at a similar rate.

\subsection{\gls{rf} dependency on \gls{aod}}

We next focus on the development of the \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} time series relative to
each other. Similar comparisons were conducted in \citet[][their Fig.\ 4]{gregory2016}
and \citet[][their Fig.\ 1]{marshall2020}, with \gls{rf} plotted against \gls{aod}.
Figure~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg} displays annual mean values from the four simulation
cases in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}; the small eruption case (\gls{c2wm}) as
blue downward pointing triangles, the intermediate eruption case (\gls{c2wmp}) as orange
thick diamonds, the large tropical eruption case (\gls{c2ws}) as green upward pointing
triangles, and the large northern hemisphere eruption case (\gls{c2wsn}) as brown upward
pointing three-branched twigs. Also shown are the data from \citet[][Fig.\ 4, black
  crosses from HadCM3 sstPiHistVol]{gregory2016} as grey crosses labelled \gls{g16}
(described in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:g16}). Additionally, the estimated peak values
from the Mt.\ Pinatubo and Mt.\ Tambora eruptions are plotted as a black star and plus,
while the peak from the \citet{jones2005} simulation is shown as a pink square labelled
\gls{j05}. Finally, red circles represent the peak values obtained from the \gls{c2w}
tropical eruption cases. The gradient lines are the same as shown by
\citet{gregory2016}. The full data range is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}a
while Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}b highlights a narrow range, focusing on the
\gls{c2wm} case.

The annual mean data from the Pinatubo-like \gls{c2wm} case in
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}b have \gls{rf} values as a function of \gls{aod} that
follow almost the same constant gradient as the \gls{g16} data. However, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}a we observe that the stronger eruptions lead to
dissimilar responses in \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}, where the slope of the \gls{c2wmp} case
seems to follow close to a \(-10\) gradient and the \gls{c2ws} case is closer to a
\(-5\) gradient. The peak values (red circles) suggest a non-linear dependence, while
within each eruption strength (same colour) the annual mean values fall relatively close
to a straight line.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics{figures/figure2.png}

  \caption{\gls{rf} as a function of \gls{aod}, yearly means. Data from the four
    simulations listed in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} (\gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp},
    \gls{c2ws} and \gls{c2wsn}) are shown along with the data from the HadCM3 sstPiHistVol
    simulation by \citet{gregory2016} (grey crosses). Also shown are the estimated peak
    values of the Mt.\ Pinatubo (black star) and Mt.\ Tambora (black plus) eruptions. In (a)
    the simulated super-volcano of \citet{jones2005} (pink square) is shown, as well as the
    peak values from the simulations \gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} (red circles).
    All peak values (as opposed to annual means) have an asterisk (\(\ast{}\)) in their
    label. The grey lines are the same regression fits as in \citet[][Fig.\ 4]{gregory2016},
    where the solid line is the fit to the Gregory et al.\ data (grey crosses). (b): Zooming
    in on the smallest \gls{aod} values.}\label{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}%
\end{figure}

To find the development of \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} relative to each other over time, we
plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios} seasonal means of the \gls{rf} to
\gls{aod} ratio, where the start of the time series is taken as the eruption day. The
plot shows all the eruption cases given in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}, as well
as the tropical eruptions from the \citet{marshall2020dataset} dataset (\(6\) of \(82\)
eruptions), labelled \gls{m20} and described in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:m20}. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}a, slopes are linear regression fits to the
seasonal means across all four ensembles, summarised in table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}.
Shaded regions are the standard deviation around the seasonal means. A similar shading
is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}b, but where the regression fits
have been omitted for clarity. Years \(1\) and \(2\) have the lowest signal-to-noise
ratio, as well as year \(0\) (the noise is mostly due to the \gls{rf} time series, shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b). For this reason, the ratio of \gls{rf} to
\gls{aod} is calculated for the second season of the first year until the end of the
third year.

Although the ratio changes across the eruption magnitudes, we find that all the tropical
cases (\gls{c2w}) follow a positive slope during the first period, as seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}a and described in
table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. A positive slope is also found from the tropical
eruptions in the \gls{m20} dataset. The northern latitude case in \gls{c2wsn} show a
much flatter slope compared to \gls{c2w} and \gls{m20}. The distinction between the
slopes from the tropical and non-tropical cases is perhaps more clear in
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}b and corresponding rows in
table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Again, \gls{c2wsn} show an almost flat slope compared
to the tropical cases. During the second period more noise is introduced, but a weak
tendency of negative slopes is found among the tropical cases.

\end{table}

\citet[][their Fig.\ 1c,d]{marshall2020} present results that demonstrate a
time-dependent relationship in the conversion between \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}. Contrary
to the results from the \gls{c2w} cases, they obtain an \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio with
a negative slope over time. As such, \citet{marshall2020} find that the aerosol forcing
efficiency increases with time rather than decrease. This phenomenon is explained by
\citet{marshall2020} as the aerosols initially are spatially confined to the hemisphere
where the eruption occurred. Subsequently, during the second and third years, they
spread globally, resulting in a higher global-mean albedo per \gls{aod} and consequently
stronger \gls{rf} per \gls{aod} ratio with time. However, this included the full
\(82\)-member ensemble. When constraining the ensemble to only include eruptions within
\(-10\) to \(\SI{10}{\degree\mathrm{N}}\), we obtain the positive slope as stated above
and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios} and
table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Therefore, the much flatter slope of \gls{c2wsn} should
be expected based on the data from \citet{marshall2020}, which indicate that tropical
eruptions contribute to a positive slope while high-latitude eruptions contribute to a
negative slope. As a result, the aerosol forcing efficiency seems strongly dependent on
eruption latitude.

\subsection{Parameter scan}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}, we compare all relevant parameters against each other.
The primary input parameter in the \gls{cesm2} is \iso{}. For our tropical cases
(\gls{c2w}), we observe an almost linear relationship between \gls{aod} peak values
against \iso{}. The latitude also plays a role for the magnitude of the \gls{aod}
perturbation, evident from \gls{c2wsn}. This weak yet significant latitude dependence
aligns with findings by \citet{marshall2019}, indicating that \(\SI{72}{\percent}\) of
the \gls{aod} variance can be attributed to \iso{}, while latitude accounts for only
\(\SI{16}{\percent}\) of the variance. Peak values from their data (82 simulations)
plotted as red thin diamonds displays a similar pattern, with \gls{aod} exhibiting close
to linear dependence on \iso{}, but with latitude introducing a spread in \gls{aod}.
Peak values from Mt.\ Pinatubo (P) and Mt.\ Tambora (T) are shown for reference, along
with peak values from \gls{j05} and \gls{t10}.

The almost linear relationship between \gls{aod} and \iso{} for the \gls{c2w} data
suggest a comparable trend for \gls{rf} versus \iso{} as seen in \gls{rf} versus
\gls{aod}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b, \gls{rf} plotted against \iso{} (with the
absolute value of \gls{rf} on the \(y\)-axis) indicates a substantial damping effect on
\gls{rf} as \iso{} increases for the \gls{c2w} data, agreeing with \gls{ob16}. The
analysis details of \gls{ob16} can be found in Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:ob16}.
Despite the model complexity difference, \citet{ottobliesner2016}'s simulations using
\gls{cesm1} with a low-top atmosphere (\gls{cam5}) produce \glspl{rf} comparable to our
findings.

    \gls{n15} is from \citet{niemeier2015}, indicating the function in
    Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.}\label{fig:parameter_scan}%
\end{figure*}

% INFO: the conversion between S and SO2 is confirmed by Niemeier and Timmreck (2015)'s
% reference to the Bekki et al. (1996) paper. Bekki uses 6000 Mt SO2, Niemeier uses 3000
% Tg(S).
\citet{niemeier2015} conducted simulations of continuous sulphur injections up to
\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\) in the ECHAM5's middle atmosphere
version \citep{giorgetta2006} with aerosol microphysics from HAM \citep{stier2005}. They
observed an \gls{rf} dependence on injection rate following an inverse exponential,
which converges to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\), depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b as the stippled pink line and given as;

\begin{equation}
  \Delta
  R_{\mathrm{TOA}} =
  -\SI{65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}
  \mathrm{e}^{-{\left(\frac{\SI{2246}{\tera\gram(S)yr^{-1}}}{x}\right)}^{0.23}}.
  \label{eq:niemeier_exponential}
\end{equation}
%
Both our simulations and the \gls{ob16} data exhibit a notably faster increase than this
exponential relationship. However, the simulations by \citet{timmreck2010} closely
correspond to the function in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Starting from an
initial input of \(\SI{850}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})}\) (equivalent to
\(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), representing the \gls{ytt} eruption), their
estimated \gls{aod} led to a peak \gls{rf} of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) (pink
filled circle in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b, labelled \gls{t10}). These results were
from a simulation utilising the MPI-ESM climate model, driven by \gls{aod} data from the
HAM aerosol model. Thus, the alignment likely stem from using the same aerosol
microphysical model in \citet{timmreck2010} and \citet{niemeier2015}, alongside applying
highly similar climate models, MPI-ESM and ECHAM5, respectively \citep{kuma2023}. The
climate model family relations are further examined in Appendix C. Notably, the peak
values from \gls{m20} align well within the upper boundary from \gls{c2w} and
\gls{ob16}, and the lower limit defined by Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Eruptions
closer to the equator within \gls{m20} correspond to data points near the upper limit,
while eruptions at higher latitudes yield weaker peak \gls{rf} values being closer to
the lower boundary. Crucially, none of the eruption simulations violated the suggested
upper threshold of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) as defined in
Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.

Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}c illustrates the response of temperature against \iso{}.
Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b, the increase of temperature response with
\iso{} decreases for higher \iso{}. Notably, \gls{ob16} takes a different trajectory
compared to \gls{c2w}, showing smaller temperature dependence on \iso{}. In contrast to
our findings, \gls{t10} finds a considerably weaker temperature perturbation, noting a
maximum temperature anomaly of only \(\SI{-3.5}{\kelvin}\) for their
\(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) eruption, while \gls{j05} records a substantially
larger maximum temperature anomaly of \(\SI{-10.7}{\kelvin}\) compared to our \gls{c2w}
simulations.

Moving to Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}d, we revisit the relationship between \gls{rf}
and \gls{aod}, focusing on peak values rather than annual and seasonal averages. As
previously discussed, the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio displays weaker gradients than
previous studies \citep{jones2005, marshall2020, timmreck2010}, with the \gls{c2w} peak
values not conforming to a linear trend. This comparison suggests potential significant
dependencies on the model and its input parameters, such as latitude, but most notably
to an inherent non-linear \gls{rf} dependence on \gls{aod}. Both the \gls{g16} and
\gls{j05} data originate from the same climate model, and similarly to what we find from
the \gls{c2w} data, the ratio is much stronger for small eruptions in the industrial era
(\gls{g16}) compared to the super-volcano eruption (\gls{j05}).

For Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}e, \gls{c2w} should resemble the patterns observed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}c due to the nearly linear association identified between
\gls{aod} and \iso{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a. This is indeed the case, and in
addition both the \gls{c2wsn} and the \gls{j05} cases align well, with the \gls{t10}
case following a similar dependence. \gls{m20} shows temperature anomalies of smaller
extent, similar to what was found in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}c. However, the
\gls{m20} experiment was conducted with prescribed sea-surface temperatures
\citep{marshall2020}, preventing the temperature from being fully perturbed.

Finally, in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}f, we compare the temperature and \gls{rf}
responses. Both \gls{c2w} and \gls{ob16} show a near-linear relationship between
temperature and \gls{rf}. The \gls{c2w} data indicate a steeper gradient, potentially
implying stronger temperature perturbations compared to \gls{ob16}. However, there are
potential biases in the values from the analysis of the \gls{ob16}, as outlined in
Appendix B, section~\ref{ap:ob16}. This, along with considerable noise, result in the
analysis of \gls{ob16} being less reliable. As in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}e, the
\gls{c2wsn} case along with the \gls{j05} and \gls{t10} cases closely follow the
temperature to \gls{rf} dependence of \gls{c2w}.

\subsection{Linearity between \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}}

Figures~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg},~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios} and
\ref{fig:parameter_scan}d demonstrate that as the \gls{aod} exceeds approximately
\(1.0\), the linear \gls{rf} dependence of approximately
\(\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) no longer hold. The almost linear
relationship between \gls{aod} and \iso{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a indicates
that larger eruptions, injecting more \ce{SO2}, lead to larger aerosols, and hence less
effective radiation scattering, thereby reducing the \gls{rf} for the same \gls{aod}
\citep{english2013, timmreck2010, timmreck2018}.

\citet{timmreck2010} highlights that for sufficiently large eruptions such as Mt.\
Pinatubo and \gls{ytt}, \ce{OH} radicals are too scarce, which limit \ce{SO2} oxidation.
The \gls{aod} peak in the \gls{ytt} simulation of \citet{timmreck2010} occur six months
after Mt.\ Pinatubo's peak. This result aligns with our findings, as illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}a, where smaller eruptions show an earlier \gls{aod}
peak. While \citet{timmreck2010} reports a peak \gls{rf} anomaly occurring \(7\)--\(8\)
months post-eruption, \citet{jones2005} suggests a peak anomaly one year post-eruption.
The \gls{rf} peak preceding the \gls{aod} peak, approximately \(6\)--\(8\) months
post-eruption in \gls{cesm2} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b), aligns well
with what was found by \citet{timmreck2010} for the \gls{ytt}. Hence, both the \gls{aod}
and \gls{rf} time series appear influenced by the \iso{} magnitude and the \ce{OH}
abundance, affecting the peak timing as well as the magnitude.

Although \gls{j05} is comparable to \gls{c2ws} concerning \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} peak
values, the temperature response reported by \citet{jones2005} appears much stronger
than what our strongest eruption leads too. Since \citet{jones2005} multiplies the
\gls{aod} time series from Mt.\ Pinatubo by one hundred to represent the \gls{aod} time
series of a super-volcano, this simple approach could potentially deviate significantly
from the real \gls{aod} time series of the super-volcano, both in shape and magnitude.
In addition, it may cause a substantially different temperature perturbation.
\citet{timmreck2010} obtained their \gls{aod} estimate from an initial injection of
\ce{SO2}, which resulted in a delayed peak, but also much smaller peak compared to that
of \gls{j05}. Also, the maximum temperature perturbation of \gls{t10} is much smaller
than that of \gls{j05}, largely due to the large difference in \gls{aod} magnitude.
Since in addition the \gls{j05} temperature is greater than that from \gls{c2ws}, it is
expected that the shape of the \gls{aod} time series is also important in determining
the strength of the aerosol forcing and corresponding temperature perturbation.

The biggest spread in the data is found when converting from \iso{} to any of the three
output parameters when comparing across models. Conversion from \iso{} to \gls{aod} is
consistent within similar models, even when comparing simulations of volcanic eruptions
\citep{timmreck2010} and continuous injection of \ce{SO2} \citep{niemeier2015}, but has
a wide spread at large values of \iso{} across model families
(figs.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a,b,c). Comparatively, the \gls{rf}
(Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}d) and temperature (Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}e) as a
function of \gls{aod} demonstrate a smaller spread across models, and consequently, the
spread for temperature as a function of \gls{rf} (Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}f) is
also small. Previous studies assumed a roughly linear relationship between \gls{rf} and
\gls{aod}, particularly for lower values of \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}, where the estimated
slope was notably steeper at around \(\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) for
\(\mathrm{AOD}<1\) compared to the approximately
\(\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) observed here at \(\mathrm{AOD}\gg1\).
Hence, a linear relationship appears to be an accurate estimate of \gls{rf} dependence
on \gls{aod} for eruptions similar to or smaller than Mt.\ Pinatubo. However, for larger
eruptions, factors like \ce{OH} scarcity and aerosol growth, influencing reflectance,
and their gravitational pull substantially impact both \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} evolution.

From the \gls{c2w} cases, a post-eruption time dependence on the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod}
ratio emerges. \citet{marshall2020} discusses a similar aspect, finding that aerosol
forcing efficiency strengths from year 1 to year 2. Here, the aerosol forcing efficiency
become weaker during the first period, as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}. This is by \citet{marshall2020} attributed to
the time taken for aerosol dispersion, affecting global albedo and consequently
\gls{rf}, whereas \gls{aod} is less affected by aerosol dispersion. Focusing solely on
tropical eruptions in \gls{m20} (between \(-10\) and \(\SI{10}{\degree\mathrm{N}}\)),
the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio closely resembles the findings from the \gls{c2wm} case.
Thus, while \iso{} is crucial for estimating the time-average of the \gls{rf} to
\gls{aod} ratio, latitude and in particular aerosol dispersion seem more influential in
determining the post-eruption evolution of the ratio. Given that the \gls{c2wsn} case
lack a significant increase in ratio as compared to the tropical eruption cases (\gls{c2w}),
the substantial difference in eruption latitude appears to be a likely cause.

\citet{marshall2019, marshall2020, marshall2021} utilise a code with seven log-normal
modes to simulate aerosol mass and number concentrations, along with an atmosphere-only
configuration of the UM-UKCA with prescribed sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice extent
\citep{marshall2019}. This approach is in contrast with \gls{cesm2}, operating as an
\gls{esm}, but with a simpler aerosol chemistry model in the \gls{mam3}. The family of
models to which \gls{m20} is based is different from that of \gls{c2w}, and also
different from the \gls{t10} and \gls{n15}, as described in Appendix C. Based on
Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}, the model family seems pivotal in determining the
estimated \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} magnitudes from \iso{}, whereas the various models
generally demonstrate more consistency in representing \gls{rf} from \gls{aod}. Given
that \gls{m20} employs a model from a distinct family compared to both \gls{ob16} and
\gls{c2w}, and \gls{t10} and \gls{n15}, while covering the parameter space between the
two families, it would be intriguing to include higher \iso{} values in the \gls{m20}
experiments to explore whether \gls{rf} against \iso{} remains bounded below (by
\gls{t10} and \gls{n15}) and above (by \gls{ob16} and \gls{c2w}), as
Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b indicate. This also prompts questions about whether
\iso{} saturation at a specific level yields a lower bound on the corresponding peak
\gls{rf} response, and if this peak \gls{rf} response is similar to what a high-latitude
eruption would produce. Alternatively, differences in model aerosol chemistry may be
what produces the wide range in \gls{rf} as a function of \iso{}.

In summary, smaller eruptions and their impact produce a relatively well defined
\gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio (\(\sim \SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\)),
whereas larger eruptions result in estimates with smaller magnitudes (\(\sim
\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) to \(\sim
\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\), as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}). \citet{niemeier2017} indicate a decrease in
aerosol forcing efficiency as the injection rate increases, due to larger volcanic
eruptions leading to larger aerosol particles that scatter sunlight less efficiently,
thereby decreasing the forcing efficiency per \iso{} \citep{english2013, timmreck2018}.

\subsection{Climate sensitivity estimate}

As previously mentioned, the results from \gls{j05} agree well with our \gls{c2ws}
experiment concerning both \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} values, yet these results differ in
temperature. To investigate this discrepancy, we here aim to conduct a comparison
between their climate feedback parameter \(\alpha \) (where \(s=1/\alpha \) is the
climate sensitivity parameter) with our climate resistance, denoted as \(\rho \), and
the \gls{tcrp} \(1/\rho\) (where \(\mathrm{TCS}=F_{2\times}\times \mathrm{TCRP}\) is the
transient climate sensitivity). As forcing of volcanic eruptions typically last for
about a year, a duration too brief for the timescales at which \(F=\rho T\) remains
valid \citep{gregory2016}, an alternative approach involves using a time-integral form
introduced by \citet{merlis2014}:

\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t=\rho\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \rho=\frac{\int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t}{\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t}.
  \label{eq:climate-resistance}
\end{equation}

If the upper bound of the integral, \(\tau \), is sufficiently large so that the upper
ocean heat capacity is the same at \(t=0\) and \(t=\tau \), this aligns with \(F=\rho
T\) \citep{gregory2016} (\citet{merlis2014} utilised \(\tau =\SI{15}{\mathrm{y}}\)).
Additionally, it's worth noting that the climate resistance and the climate feedback
parameter are associated with the ocean heat uptake efficiency (\(\kappa \)) through
\(\rho =\alpha +\kappa \).

The climate feedback parameter, as estimated by \citet{jones2005}, stands at
approximately \(\alpha \simeq \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), exceeding twice
the value obtained by \citet{gregory2016} in their simulations using Mt.\ Pinatubo
within the HadCM3 climate model.

We determine the climate resistance using the integral-form computation outlined in
Eq.~\ref{eq:climate-resistance} and adopting \(\tau =\SI{8}{\mathrm{yr}}\), coinciding
with the duration of our simulations. The estimated climate resistance \(\rho \) from
the three tropical simulation cases (with four in each ensemble) yields
\(\SI{3(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), and \gls{tcrp} (\(1/\rho\)) values of
\(\SI{0.4(1)}{\kelvin\watt^{-1}\metre^{2}}\), as demonstrated in table~\ref{tab:trcp}.
One outlier was found in the dataset from the \gls{c2wm} case, and omitting this data
point leaves estimates of \(\SI{2.4(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\) and
\(\SI{0.42(4)}{\kelvin\watt^{-1}\metre^{2}}\).

The climate resistance parameter \(\rho\) differs from the climate feedback parameter
estimated by \citet{jones2005} (\(\alpha\)). However, considering both \(\alpha\) and
\(\kappa\) are positive, and our calculated values of \(\rho(=\alpha+\kappa)\) are
smaller than the \citet{jones2005} estimate of \(\alpha \simeq
\SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), we deduce that the climate feedback parameter
linked to the simulations conducted here must be notably lower than what
\citet{jones2005} found. It is worth noting that the temperature time series are not
fully equilibrated after eight years, but as integrating over a longer time would only
reduce the estimated values of \(\rho\), it is expected that this contribution is
unimportant when comparing our \(\rho\) to the \(\alpha\) used in \gls{j05}.

Since the temperature perturbation obtained by \gls{j05} was higher than any achieved
here, it indicates that the forcing used by \gls{j05} must be stronger.
\citet{gregory2016} mentioned that the peak forcing value was about \(20\) times smaller
than expected, but from the results shown here, this reduced aerosol forcing efficiency
is expected and akin to the \gls{rf} dependency on \gls{aod} found here. Inspecting
Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan} we find that the aerosol forcing efficiency is somewhat
smaller in \gls{j05}. We therefore expect the primary contributor to the overall
increased forcing strength to stem from the shape of the forcing time series utilised,
not the magnitude.

\section{Summary and conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we considered three medium to super-volcano sized eruptions and compared
them to previously reported results. We find that the peak arrival in the \gls{aod} time
series is later post-eruption for larger volcanoes than smaller, and also that larger
volcanoes produce a sharper peak in the \gls{aod} time series. The \gls{rf} time series
are similar across all volcano sizes, and while the smallest volcano experience a faster
temperature decay, the two larger volcanoes produce time series indistinguishable in
shape for both \gls{rf} and temperature. Thus, a simple scaling of the \gls{aod} time
series from a smaller volcano is insufficient in representing a larger volcanic
eruption.

We investigate the \gls{rf} as a function of \gls{aod}, and find that an \gls{rf}
dependence of \(\sim\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) is consistent with our
results for volcanoes of similar size in terms of \iso{} as Mt.\ Pinatubo. Larger
volcanoes with one to two orders of magnitude more \iso{} is found to produce a much
more shallow \gls{rf} gradient closer to \(\sim
\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\). A more shallow gradient for larger
volcanoes is also consistent with data from previous studies of super-volcanoes.

The time-after-eruption dependence of the ratio between \gls{rf} and \gls{aod} is found
to weaken with time resulting in a reduced aerosol forcing efficiency. The effect is
found across all volcano sizes, but only the tropical cases show a clear trend. The
high-latitude case experience an almost constant efficiency with time. A similar
analysis has been carried out before by \citet{marshall2020}, who found that the
efficiency increase with time when all eruptions were considered. However, we find that
when only their tropical eruptions are considered, a reduced efficiency is found as well
as a similar ratio to what our volcanoes of similar size produced. Thus, the results
align well when comparing tropical eruptions, and it is evident that latitude is
significant in deciding the aerosol forcing efficiency generally, and as a function of
time-after-eruption specifically.

There is a large spread in the conversion between \iso{} and \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}
across models and in particular model families. Improving the consistency in how
\ce{SO2} and \ce{H2SO4} is treated in models would be an important step in improving the
accuracy of volcanic eruptions influence on climate. Simulations of larger volcanic
eruptions with \iso{} of at least \(200\)--\(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\mathrm{SO2})}\) would
provide useful data for a more precise determination of the functional shape of the
\gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio. Allowing for different latitudes, similar to the \gls{m20}
dataset, would also provide fruitful data to study more closely whether the functional
given in Eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential} is indeed a lower bound for \gls{rf} as a
function of \iso{}.

\appendixtitle{Simulation set up and output}

Input files used in the simulations were created using a modified version of the file
\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl},
via a Python project developed on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking}. The project is also available from the
Python package manager PyPI\@. The program creates volcanoes with a given \ce{SO2}
amount that is injected over six
hours\footnote{\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl}}
at a given latitude, longitude and altitude. All volcanic \ce{SO2} files are created by
setting the eruption details in a~.json file that is read to the
\texttt{volcano-cooking} CLI at a fixed version, making for a reproducible experiment
setup.

We are using the \texttt{BWma1850} component
setup\footnote{\url{https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/config/2.1.0/compsets.html}}
to run the \gls{cesm2}, and an accompanying \gls{fsst} simulation to obtain estimates of
the \gls{rf}. The \gls{fsst} simulation used is not from a standardised component setup
as of \gls{cesm2} (v2.1.3), but is instead specified in full.\footnote{\fssturl} They
differ in \texttt{CICE -> CICE\%PRES}, which is prescribed sea-ice,
\texttt{POP2\%ECO\%DEP -> DOCN\%DOM} which is from a dynamical ocean to a prescribed
data ocean and the wave component \texttt{WW3 -> SWAV} which is now a stub wave
component instead of the full \gls{ww3}.

\gls{rf} is calculated as the combined (\gls{sw} and \gls{lw}) all-sky \gls{toa} energy
imbalance, where the \gls{cesm2} provide the output variables \gls{fsnt} and \gls{flnt}.
Thus, \(\mathrm{RF_*}= \mathrm{FSNT} - \mathrm{FLNT}\), and taking the difference
between volcanic simulations and a control simulation gives the final estimate of
\gls{rf} (\(\mathrm{RF}=\mathrm{RF_{VOLC}}-\mathrm{RF_{CONTROL}}\))
\citep{marshall2020}. The output parameters that go into this estimate are from he
\gls{fsst} simulation, hence this outline specifically describe how to calculate
\gls{erf} as opposed to \gls{irf}, which instead is the difference between the \gls{erf}
and the sum of all rapid atmospheric adjustments \citep{marshall2020,smith2018}. The
\gls{aod} is obtained from the output variable \gls{aodm}, while global temperature is
saved by \gls{cesm2} to the variable \gls{trefht}. These four output variables are all
that are used throughout this paper. The important input data used in the model
simulations are \iso{} in units of teragrams (\(\si{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\)), used to
simulate volcanic eruptions.

\appendix[B]

\appendixtitle{External data}

\subsection{Otto-Bliesner data analysis}\label{ap:ob16}

Data from \citet{ottobliesner2016} are the original input data of \iso{} as used in
their model simulations, where corresponding \gls{rf} and temperature data are found as
the value of the time series at the time of an eruption (according to the \iso{} time
series). Therefore, \gls{rf} and temperature values may be somewhat smaller in
figs.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b,c,f than their true value. Specifically, an ensemble of
5 is used for both \gls{rf} and temperature, and a mean from the 5 is used as the de
facto \gls{rf} and temperature time series. A control simulation of a single time series
is used to remove seasonal dependence from the temperature, where the control simulation
is averaged into a climatology mean. Further, a drift in the temperature is removed by
subtracting a linear regression fit. \gls{rf} have seasonality removed in the Fourier
domain. The forcing (\ce{SO2}) can be downloaded with direct link
\url{https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/volc/IVI2LoadingLatHeight501-2000_L18_c20100518.nc},
or found at \url{https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/paleo/simulations/ccsm4-lm}
and \url{https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/volc/}.

The time of an eruption is decided based on a best attempt at aligning the \ce{SO2} time
series with both the \gls{rf} time series and the temperature time series individually.
The \gls{rf} and temperature values used in the \gls{ob16} data points are the exact
values at day 340 (\gls{rf}) and 400 (temperature) after the eruption according to the
\iso{} time series. Thus, missing the peak means the estimates will be biased towards
lower values, while other eruptions occurring close in time will contribute a bias to
higher values.

\subsection{Marshall data analysis}\label{ap:m20}

Data used to generate the \gls{m20} data points was from \citet{marshall2020dataset},
available at \url{https://doi.org/10.5285/232164e8b1444978a41f2acf8bbbfe91}. As each
file contain a single eruption, peak values of \gls{aod}, \gls{rf} and temperature was
found by applying a Savitzky-Golay filter of third order and one year window length, and
choosing the maximum value.

\subsection{Gregory data analysis}\label{ap:g16}

Data used to generate the \gls{g16} data points was kindly provided by Jonathan Gregory
(personal communication). The full 160-year long time series were further analysed by
computing annual means.

\appendix[C]

\appendixtitle{Model families}

The model utilised here was the \gls{cesm2} which is an ancestor of \gls{cesm1} utilised
by \gls{ob16}. They belong to a different model family than both the HadCM3 (\gls{j05}
and \gls{g16}) and the UM-UKCA (\gls{m20}), which is an extended version of HadGEM3
\citep{dhomse2014}, and an ancestor of HadCM3. A third model family is represented
through ECHAM5 (\gls{n15}) and MPI-ESM (\gls{t10}), where the latter is related to the
former via the ECHAM6. A summary of the model code genealogy is detailed in
table~\ref{tab:model-family}, based on the model code genealogy map created by
\citet{kuma2023}.
