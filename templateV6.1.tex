\abstract{%
  Large to super-volcano sized eruptions are simulated in the \gls{cesm2} climate model
  with the \gls{waccm} atmosphere. Ensembles containing four members are simulated, and
  the \gls{aod}, \gls{rf} and temperature anomaly from the eruptions are compared.
  Simulating a Pinatubo-like eruption yields results consistent with several previous
  studies with a slope of \(\sim \SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) per unit \gls{aod} for
  \gls{rf}. Larger eruptions, however, give a shallower slope indicative of a lower
  forcing efficiency. Moreover, a time-after-eruption dependence between \gls{aod} and
  \gls{rf} is found, where the \gls{rf} is relatively stronger than \gls{aod} the first
  year after the eruption (higher forcing efficiency), while later their ratio is
  roughly constant for a given eruption strength.

% NOTE: what to include in the paper, key questions.
% The paper should provide insight about what might happen if a large volcano erupted
% (order of magnitude or more than Mt.\ Pinatubo). How does the atmosphere react, for
% example in the aerosol dynamics? (QBO, SO2/AOD/RF relationship.) It should also be
% about how volcanic simulations compare in magnitude and if there is time for more
% simulations, how model complexity (dynamic ocean against slab ocean) affect things.
% - How far does the linear relation between AOD and RF go? What phases does the
%   aerosols go though? (Perhaps the most promising avenue.)
% - How much does it matter how high in the atmosphere the initial SO2 is injected?
%   (Already is some literature on this, suggesting it is not much. Also some on
%   latitude dependence, which has a bigger influence.)
% - How does the climate response change based on the state of the climate: what if we
%   run a CO2 doubling or quadrupling simulation until close to equilibrium, and let the
%   volcanoes erupt then? (Lack the doubling scenario, and setting it up has resulted in
%   strange output that must be resolved. Could take a while.)

\Gls{rf} and \gls{aod} are crucial metrics representing the energy imbalance at
\gls{toa} and the stratospheric opacity due to aerosol scattering. They are extensively
utilized to quantify the impact of major volcanic eruptions. The assumption of a linear
dependency of \gls{rf} on \gls{aod} is commonly adopted \citep{myhre2013,andersson2015},
and applying such a linear relationship have yielded reasonably accurate estimates in
climate model simulations of volcanic eruptions
\citep{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Despite this, there
is a wide spread in the estimated volcanic forcing efficiencies (\gls{rf} normalised by
\gls{aod}) among the studies, spanning approximately \(\sim
\SI{15}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{pitari2016b} to \(\sim
\SI{25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\ce{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{myhre2013}, predominantly based on
\gls{aod} values up to at most \(\sim 0.7\).

Although \ce{H2O}, \ce{N2} and \ce{CO2} are the most abundant gases emitted by volcanoes
\citep{robock2000}, sulphur species such as \ce{SO2} hold greater influence due to the
comparatively high concentrations of the former gases in the atmosphere. The
transformation of \ce{SO2} molecules through reactions with \ce{OH} and \ce{H2O} leads
to the formation of sulphate acis (\ce{H2SO4}) \citep{robock2000}, which scatter
sunlight, elevating planetary albedo and consequently the \gls{rf}. As the conversion
from \ce{SO2} to \ce{H2SO4} occurs over weeks \citep{robock2000}, the peak \gls{rf} from
the eruption experiences a slight delay from the eruption's. The duration of time the
\ce{H2SO4} aerosols stay in the stratosphere depends on various factors, including
latitude \citep{marshall2019, toohey2019}, volcanic plume height \citep{marshall2019},
aerosol size \citep{marshall2019}, \gls{qbo} phase \citep{pitari2016b} and the season of
the year (determining to which hemisphere aerosols are transported)
\citep{toohey2011,toohey2019}. In the case of tropical eruptions, aerosols are typically
transported poleward in the stratosphere and back to mid-latitude troposphere within one
to two years \citep{robock2000}. Upon descending below the tropopause, these aerosols
are readily removed by wet deposition \citep{liu2012}.

Before the current era of significant anthropogenic climate forcing, volcanic eruptions
primarily dictated Earth's climate variability during the Holocene period
\citep{sigl2022}. Despite this substantial impact, few climate model experiments have
included volcanic forcing when simulating climate evolution during the Holocene
\citep{sigl2022}, implying an exaggerated positive forcing
\citep{gregory2016,solomon2011}. This absence of persistent cooling is one of several
factors that has been suggested to contribute to the common disparity between simulated
and observed global warming \citep{andersson2015}. Despite extensive attention on
understanding how volcanic eruptions influence climate, questions regarding aerosol
particle processes---such as their growth and creation rates when \ce{OH} is
scarce---remain unanswered
\citep[e.g.][]{robock2000,zanchettin2019,marshall2020,marshall2022}. These processes
impact aerosol scattering efficiency and potentially the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod}
relationship. \citet{marshall2020} observed higher efficiencies in years \(2\) and \(3\)
post-eruption compared to year 1, attributing this to spatial concentration in the
initial year and subsequent dispersion. This spatial alteration increases the albedo per
global mean \gls{aod}, consequently elevating the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio
\citep{marshall2020}.

Previous studies on both Mt.\ Pinatubo \citep{mills2017,hansen2005} and volcanoes within
the instrumental era \citep{gregory2016} have been used to estimate the relationship
between the \gls{rf} energy imbalance and change in \gls{aod} caused by volcanic
eruptions. While \citet{myhre2013} employ a \gls{rf} formula scaling \gls{aod} by
\(\SI{-25}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\), recent literature reports estimates
down to \(\SI{-19.0(5)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{gregory2016} and
\(\SI{-18.3(10)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) \citep{mills2017}. Synthetic
volcano simulations in \citet{marshall2020} yield a scaling factor of
\(\SI{-20.5(2)}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) across 82 simulations featuring
varying injection heights and latitudes of volcanic emissions, ranging from \(10\) to
\(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

A similar simulation setup, albeit with notable differences, was conducted by
\citet{niemeier2015}, involving \(14\) levels of injected sulphur spanning between
\(\SI{1}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)) and
\(\SI{100}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)
(\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\)). These geoengineering simulations
maintained continous sulphur injections, running until a steady sulphur level was
achieved. Results indicated an inverse exponential relationship between \gls{rf} and
\iso{} rate, converging to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\)
(eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}). Notably, even though the super-volcano simulation
by \citet{jones2005} have a much weaker gradient of \(\sim
\SI{-4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) when compared to more recent literature,
the peak \gls{rf} obtained in their simulation was \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\), still
below the suggested limit of \(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\). Moreover,
\citet{timmreck2010} find a peak \gls{rf} anomaly of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) from
\(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), which corresponds well with the function estimated
by \citet{niemeier2015}.

One avenue that has garnered considerable attention is comparing the magnitude of
forcing from volcanoes or volcano-like forcings compared to increased \ce{CO2} levels.
Several studies explore the connection between volcanic forcing and the climate
sensitivity to a doubling of \ce{CO2}
\citep{boer2007,marvel2016,merlis2014,ollila2016,richardson2019,salvi2022,wigley2005}.
This comparison aims to mitigate the large uncertainty in estimates of the sensitivity
of the real climate system. Inferring climate sensitivity from volcanic events has been
attempted as a means of constraining the sensitivity \citep{boer2007}, assuming that
volcanic and \ce{CO2} forcings produce similar feedbacks \citep{pauling2023}. Earlier
studies suggest the potential for constraining \gls{ecs} using volcanoes
\citep{bender2010}, provided that \gls{ecs} is constrained by \gls{erf} rather than
\gls{irf}, as \gls{erf} accounts for rapid atmospheric adjustments in contrast to
\gls{irf} \citep{richardson2019}. However, other studies refute this by indicating
different sensitivities between volcanic forcing and \ce{CO2} doubling
\citep{douglass2006} or asserting that constraining the \gls{ecs} by \gls{erf} lacks
accuracy due to the precision of climate simulations \citep{boer2007,salvi2022}.
Although \gls{erf} offers a more suitable indicator of forcing than \gls{irf}
\citep{marvel2016,richardson2019}, more recent studies conclude that \gls{ecs} cannot be
constrained from volcanic events \citep{pauling2023}.

Several studies have demonstrated a linear relationship of approximately
\(-\SI{20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) between \gls{rf} and \gls{aod}, although
substantial variability exists in the slope among studies
\citep{mills2017,hansen2005,gregory2016,marshall2020,pitari2016b}. Moreover, a
time-after-eruption dependence on the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio is found in
\citet{marshall2020}, whereas \citet{niemeier2015} revealed a non-linear relationship
between \gls{rf} and \iso{}. Thus, a consensus on the relationship between \iso{},
\gls{aod} and \gls{rf} has yet to be established.

To address these issues we conducted ensemble simulations of volcanic eruptions in
\gls{cesm2}, spanning \iso{} levels of three orders of magnitude:
\(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) and
\(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\). Details regarding the experimental setup are
provided in section~\ref{sec:method}. Our finding reveal clear non-linear \gls{rf} to
\gls{aod} dependencies for large to super-volcano scale eruptions. Additionally, we
observe a time-dependent variation in the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio, detailed in
section~\ref{sec:results} and discussed in section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Furthermore,
our data, along with insights from previous studies, suggest that the \gls{rf} to \iso{}
dependency identified by \citet{niemeier2015} acts as a lower boundary. Our conclusions
are presented in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

We utilized the \gls{cesm2} \citep{danabasoglu2020} in conjunction with the \gls{waccm}
\citep{gettleman2019} and the fully dynamical ocean component \gls{pop}
\citep{smith2010, danabasoglu2020}. The atmosphere model was run at nominal
\(\SI{2}{\degree}\) resolution with \(70\) vertical levels in the \gls{ma}
configuration.

The \gls{waccm} version employed in the \gls{ma} configuration uses the \gls{mam3}
\citep{gettleman2019}, a simplified and computationally efficient default setting within
the \gls{cam5} \citep{liu2016}, as described in \citet{liu2012}. The \gls{mam3} was
developed from MAM7, consisting of the seven modes Aitken, accumulation, primary carbon,
fine dust and fine sea salt, coarse dust and coarse sea salt. Instantaneous internal
mixing of primary carbonaceous aerosols with secondary aerosols and instantaneous ageing
of primary carbonaceous particles is assumed by emitting primary carbon in the
accumulation mode \citep{liu2016}. Fine sea salt is assimilated into the accumulation
mode, and as dust absorbs water efficiently it is expected to be removed by wet
deposition similarly to sea salt, allowing fine dust to be merged into the accumulation
mode as well. Likewise, coarse dust is merged with coarse sea salt into a coarse mode,
and as both absorb water efficiently, the coarse mode will quickly retain its background
state below the tropopause \citep{liu2012}. Consequenctly, \gls{mam3} features three
modes: Aitken, accumulation and coarse \citep{liu2016}.

\subsection{Simulations}

Appendix A provides a detailed description of the simulation setup and utilized output
variables. Table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} summarizes the simulations, encompassing
three \ce{SO2} injection magnitudes across four seasons: February 15th, May 15th, August
15th, and November 15th. The magnitudes vary over three orders of magnitude:
\(\SI{26}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), \(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\), and
\(\SI{1629}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\).

The smallest eruption case (\gls{c2wm}) aligns with the magnitude of events like Mt.\
Pinatubo \citep[\(\sim10\)--\(\SI{20}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);~e.g.][]{timmreck2018} and
Mt.\ Tambora \citep[\(\sim\SI{56.2}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);~e.g.][]{zanchettin2016}.
The intermediate case (\gls{c2wmp}) resembles the 1257 Samalas eruption
\citep[\(\sim{118.8}\)--\(\SI{173.1}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);~e.g.][]{toohey2017,ottobliesner2016},
while the largest eruption case (\gls{c2ws}) is similar to the \gls{ytt} eruption
\citep[\(100\)--\(\SI{10000}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\);~e.g.][]{jones2005}. All eruptions
were situated at the equator (\(\SI{0}{\degree N}\), \(\SI{1}{\degree E}\)) with
\ce{SO2} injected between \(\SI{18}{\kilo\meter}\) and \(\SI{20}{\kilo\meter}\).
Collectively, the three eruption cases \gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} are
referred to as \gls{c2w}. Two additional high-latitude eruptions (\gls{c2wsn}) of the
same \iso{} magnitude as \gls{c2ws} were simulated at \(\SI{56}{\degree N}\),
\(\SI{287.7}{\degree E}\) with a six-month separation (February 15th and August 15th).

Employing eruptions in the large to super-volcano size enhances the signal-to-noise
ratio without necessitating an extensive and computationally expensive ensemble.
However, the forcing values obtained from the climate model simulations may not be
realistic or more specifically an appropriate representation of smaller eruptions
typical of the historical period \citep{gregory2016}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

% NOTE: the results should be laid out in a logical way, with the most
% interesting/important stuff first, then tangents that dig deeper at specific things
% later.
% 1. RF to AOD time-after-eruption dependence should be top priority (8 figs atm.)
% 2. Then probably temperature scaling since we discuss the shape of both AOD and RF
%    time series before that (MOTIVATION: can we expect a specific temperature time
%    series shape based on the shape of either of or both of the RF and AOD time
%    series?)
% 3. If there is something interesting to say about the rest of the figures (all the
%    comparing of parameters), then this should come here.

\subsection{Analysis of the time series}

Fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp} illustrates time series of the global mean
\gls{aod}, \gls{rf}, and surface air temperature. The black lines represent the medians
across the four-member ensembles, while shading indicates the 5th to 95th percentiles.
Three distinct forcing magnitudes (\gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp}, and \gls{c2ws}), outlined in
table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}, have been used. The time series in
fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp} are normalised by setting the peak value to unity,
defined based on the peak of a fit utilising a Savitzky-Golay filter of 3rd order and a
one-year window length.

A notable feature across all three subfigures of fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp} is
the earlier peak occurrence of the \gls{c2wm} case compared to the larger eruption
cases. Cases \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} peak at similar times, but the \gls{c2wmp} case
exhibit a faster rise in the \gls{aod} time series
(fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}a). Additionally in
fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}a we find that the stronger eruption cases display a
sharper peak, or similarly a slower rise and faster decay. The rise across the eruption
cases in fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b is similar, but where the \gls{c2wm} case
reach the peak just prior to the other two cases. Although the rise in the eruption
cases in fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b is similar, the \gls{c2wm} case reaches
its peak just before the other two cases. During the decay phase, all cases appear to
decay at a similar rate, maintaining the offset caused by the earlier peak arrival of
\gls{c2wm}. Cases \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} exhibit indistinguishable \gls{rf} time
series. Similarly, in fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}, when observing the
temperature evolution, cases \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} are indistinguishable. The
\gls{c2wm} case spends less time around the peak but decays much faster compared to the
\gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} cases.

Across all cases in each of the parameters shown in
fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}, no non-linear effects appear to have an impact,
even in the \gls{c2ws} super-volcano case. Comparing the two strongest eruption cases
(\gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws}), where noise play a much smaller role, the \gls{rf} and
temperature time series are indistinguishable from each other. Therefore, similar
dynamics are expected to be at play in all cases.

\begin{figure}

    three tropical volcanic eruption cases, \gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws}. The time
    series have been normalised to have peak values at unity, where \(C\) is the
    normalisation constant. Black lines indicate the median across the four-member
    ensembles, while shading marks the 5th and 95th
    percentiles.}\label{fig:compare-waveform-temp}%
\end{figure}

Next, we investigate whether the shape of the temperature time series can be inferred
from the shape of either of the forcing time series (\gls{aod} or \gls{rf}). When
plotting the \gls{rf} time series, we find that their shapes are consistent over
different eruption strengths (fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b), suggesting a
strong dependence of temperature on \gls{rf}. The same can largely be said about the
\gls{aod} time series as well, but they do show a slight change in shape from smaller to
larger eruptions (fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}a). Specifically, the \gls{aod}
time series from smaller eruptions display a fast rise and a flat peak before decaying
back to their equilibrium state. From the larger eruptions, we find a slower rise time
but a sharper peak, resulting in a decay to equilibrium happening at a similar time
after the eruption and at a similar rate.

\subsection{\gls{rf} dependency on \gls{aod}}

We next focus on how the \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} time series develop relative to each
other. Similar comparisons were conducted in \citet[][their Fig.\ 4]{gregory2016} and
\citet[][their Fig.\ 1]{marshall2020}, with \gls{rf} plotted against \gls{aod}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg} displays annual mean values from the four simulation
cases in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}; the small eruption case (\gls{c2wm}) as
blue downward pointing triangles, the intermediate eruption case (\gls{c2wmp}) as orange
thick diamonds, the large tropical eruption case (\gls{c2ws}) as green upward pointing
triangles, and the large northern hemisphere eruption case (\gls{c2wsn}) as brown upward
pointing three-branched twigs. Also shown are the data from \citet[][Fig.\ 4, black
  crosses from HadCM3 sstPiHistVol]{gregory2016} as grey crosses labelled \gls{g16}.
Additionally, the estimated peak values from the Mt.\ Pinatubo and Mt.\ Tambora
eruptions are plotted as a purple star and a yellow plus, while the peak from the
\gls{j05} simulation is shown as a pink square. Finally, red circles represent the peak
values obtained from the \gls{c2w} tropical eruption cases. The gradient lines are the
same as shown by \citet{gregory2016}. The full data range is shown in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}a while fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}b highlights a
narrow range, focusing on the \gls{c2wm} case.

The annual mean data from the Pinatubo-like \gls{c2wm} case in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}b have \gls{rf} values as a function of \gls{aod} that
follow almost the same constant gradient as the \gls{g16} data. However, in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}a we observe that the stronger eruptions lead to
dissimilar responses in \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}, where the slope of the \gls{c2wmp} case
seems to follow close to a \(-10\) gradient and the \gls{c2ws} case is closer to a
\(-5\) gradient. The peak values (red circles) suggest a non-linear functional shape
dependence, while within each eruption strength (same colour) the annual mean values
fall relatively close to a straight line.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/figure2.png}

  \caption{\gls{rf} as a function of \gls{aod}, yearly means. Data from the four
    simulations listed in table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview} (\gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp},
    \gls{c2ws} and \gls{c2wsn}) are shown along with the data from the HadCM3 sstPiHistVol
    simulation by \citet{gregory2016} (grey crosses). Also shown are the estimated peak
    values of the Mt.\ Pinatubo (purple star) and Mt.\ Tambora (yellow plus) eruptions. In
    (a) the simulated super-volcano of \citet{jones2005} (pink square) is shown as well as
    the peak values from the simulations \gls{c2wm}, \gls{c2wmp} and \gls{c2ws} as red
    circles. All peak values (as opposed to annual means) have an asterisk (\(\ast{}\)) in
    their label. The grey gradient lines are the same regression fits as in \citet[][Fig.\
      4]{gregory2016}, where the solid line is the fit to the Gregory et al.\ data (grey
    crosses). (b): Zooming in on the smallest values.}\label{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}%
\end{figure}

To observe how the responses in \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} develop relative to each other
over time, we plot in fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios} seasonal means of the
\gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio, where the start of the time series is taken as that of the
eruption day. The plot shows all the eruption cases given in
table~\ref{tab:simulation-overview}, as well as the tropical eruptions from the
\citet{marshall2020dataset} dataset, labelled \gls{m20}. In
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}a, straight lines are linear regression fits to
the seasonal means across all four ensembles, summarised in
table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. Shaded regions are the standard deviation around the
seasonal means. A similar shading is plotted in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}b, but where the regression fits have been
omitted to avoid further cluttering the plot. The years where the signal-to-noise ratio
is the lowest are years \(1\) and \(2\), as well as year \(0\) (the noise is mostly due
to the \gls{rf} time series, shown in fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b). For this
reason, the ratio of \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} is calculated for the second season of the
first year until the end of the third year.

Although the ratio changes between the eruption magnitudes, we find that the gradient at
which the ratio is changing is similar across large eruption magnitudes, summarised in
table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}. A slope of around \(4\)--\(5\) during the first period
is a good fit for both the \gls{c2wmp} case and the \gls{c2ws} case
(table~\ref{tab:slope-gradients}, row ``fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}a''),
and even though the spread in the \gls{c2wm} case is large in the \(y\)-direction, they
tend to follow a similarly inclined, albeit steeper, slope. Normalising the time series
before computing the ratio, shown in fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}b, yields
a similarly inclined slope across all forcing magnitude ensembles except the \gls{c2wsn}
case at high latitude. In the 2nd period, from the second season of the second year, the
ratios stay close to constant for the reminder of the decaying phase of the time series.
Again, this is necessarily the case also in the normalised version in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}b, but here the effect of a smaller
signal-to-noise ratio into the third year becomes apparent.

\end{table}

\citet[][their Fig.\ 1c,d]{marshall2020} present results that demonstrate a
time-dependent relationship in the conversion between \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}. Contrary
to the results from the \gls{cesm2} simulations, \gls{rf} displays larger magnitudes
compared to \gls{aod} at later stages in the eruption evolution (higher efficiency), not
smaller. This phenomenon is explained by \citet{marshall2020} as the aerosols initially
being spatially confined to the hemisphere where the eruption occurred. Subsequently,
during the second and third years, they spread globally, resulting in a higher global
mean albedo per \gls{aod} and consequently larger \gls{rf} per \gls{aod}. When a similar
analysis to that in fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}a is applied to the
\gls{m20} data (utilised by \citet{marshall2020}), considering eruptions between \(-10\)
and \(\SI{10}{\degree\mathrm{N}}\), the ratio increases similarly to the \gls{c2wmp}
case rather than decreasing. The slopes observed are approximately
\(\sim\SI{6.34}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) and
\(\sim\SI{-0.36}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\), akin to the \gls{c2wm} case.
Additionally, we note that the slope obtained from our high-latitude case exhibits a
significantly weaker slope than the tropical cases, aligning with the \gls{m20} data.
Considering the \gls{m20} data and the results depicted in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}, it appears that various and competing effects
determine the values of \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}, with latitude playing a pivotal role.

The change in ratio, where the smallest ratio corresponds to larger eruptions and the
largest ratio corresponds to smaller eruptions, aligns with the shift observed in peak
values as illustrated in fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg}a. Here, the red circles
indicate that the peak values saturate in \gls{rf}. The peak magnitudes of \gls{rf}
increase at a slower rate compared to the \gls{aod} peak magnitudes, which rise almost
linearly with \iso{} (also visible in fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a). This trend might
be due to larger aerosols having time to develop as the amount of \iso{} increases
\citep{niemeier2015,marshall2019}. Consequently, this leads to smaller eruptions'
forcing being more efficient than that of large eruptions, as larger aerosols scatter
radiation less efficiently, resulting in a smaller \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio.

    \gls{m20}.}\label{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}%
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameter scan}

In fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}, we compare all relevant parameters against each other.
The primary input parameter in the \gls{cesm2} is \iso{}. For out tropical cases
(\gls{c2w}), shown in fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a, we observe an almost linear
relationship between \gls{aod} peak values and \iso{}. The latitude also play a role for
the extent of the \gls{aod} perturbation, evident from the \gls{c2wsn} data point. This
latitude dependence aligns with findings by \citet{marshall2019}, indicating that
\(\SI{72}{\percent}\) of the \gls{aod} variance can be attributed to \iso{}, while
latitude accounts for only \(\SI{16}{\percent}\) of the variance. Peak values from their
data (82 simulations) plotted as green thin diamonds displays a similar pattern, with
\gls{aod} exhibiting close to linear dependence on \iso{}, but where latitude introduce
a spread in \gls{aod}. Peak values from Mt.\ Pinatubo (P) and Mt.\ Tambora (T) are shown
for reference, along with peak values from \gls{j05} and \gls{t10}.

The almost linear relationship between \gls{aod} and \iso{} for the \gls{c2w} data
suggest a comparable trend for \gls{rf} versus \iso{} as seen in \gls{rf} versus
\gls{aod}. In fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b, \gls{rf} plotted against \iso{} (with the
absolute value of \gls{rf} on the \(y\)-axis) indicates a substantial damping effect on
\gls{rf} as \iso{} increases, akin to the behaviour seen in the \gls{ob16} data. The
analysis details of the \gls{ob16} data can be found in Appendix B. Despite the model
complexity difference, \citet{ottobliesner2016}'s simulations using \gls{cesm1} with a
low-top atmosphere (\gls{cam5}) produce \glspl{rf} comparable to out findings.

    labelled \gls{n15} is from \citet{niemeier2015}, indicating the function in
    eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.}\label{fig:parameter_scan}%
\end{figure*}

% INFO: the conversion between S and SO2 is confirmed by Niemeier and Timmreck (2015)'s
% reference to the Bekki et al. (1996) paper. Bekki uses 6000 Mt SO2, Niemeier uses 3000
% Tg(S).
\citet{niemeier2015} conducted simulations of continuous sulphur injections up to
\(\SI{200}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}\) in the ECHAM5's middle atmosphere
version \citep{giorgetta2006} with aerosol microphysics from HAM \citep{stier2005}. They
observed an \gls{rf} dependence on injection rate \(x\) following an inverse exponential
converging to \(\SI{-65}{\watt\meter^{-2}}\) depicted in fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b
as the stippled pink line and given as

\begin{equation}
  \Delta
  R_{\mathrm{TOA}} =
  -\SI{65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}
  \mathrm{e}^{-{\left(\frac{\SI{2246}{\tera\gram(S)yr^{-1}}}{x}\right)}^{0.23}}.
  \label{eq:niemeier_exponential}
\end{equation}

Both our simulations and the findings from \citet{ottobliesner2016} exhibit a notably
slower increase than the exponential function. Interestingly, the simulations by
\citet{timmreck2010}, utilising the MPI-ESM and driven by \gls{aod} data from the HAM
aerosol model, for an eruption simulating the \gls{ytt} event
(\(\SI{850}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})}\)), closely correspond to the function presented in
eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. This alignment stems from using the same aerosol
microphysical model in both \citet{timmreck2010} and \citet{niemeier2015}, alongside
highly similar \glspl{esm}; the MIP-ESM is the precursor of ECHAM6, the subsequent
version update from ECHAM5 \citep{kuma2023}. Beginning with an initial input of
\(\SI{850}{\tera\gram(\ce{S})}\) (equivalent to \(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\)),
their estimated \gls{aod} led to a peak \gls{rf} of \(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) (pink
filled circle in fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b, labelled \gls{t10}). Notably, the peak
values from the \gls{m20} dataset align neatly within the upper boundary from the
\gls{cesm} data (\gls{c2w} and \gls{ob16}) and the lower limit defined by
eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}. Eruptions closer to the equator within the \gls{m20}
dataset correspond to data points near the upper limit, while eruptions at higher
latitudes yield weaker peak \gls{rf} values closer to the lower boundary. Crucially,
none of the eruption simulations violated the suggested upper threshold of
\(\SI{-65}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) as defined in eq.~\ref{eq:niemeier_exponential}.

Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}c illustrates the response of temperature against \iso{}.
Similar to fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b, the \gls{c2w} data deviates, indicating a
relatively weaker temperature response with increased \iso{} levels. Notably, the
\gls{ob16} dataset takes a different trajectory compared to the \gls{c2w} data,
showcasing less extreme temperature fluctuations as \iso{} rises. In contrast to our
findings, \gls{t10} demonstrates a considerably weaker temperature perturbation, noting
a maximum temperature anomaly of only \(\SI{-3.5}{\kelvin}\) for their
\(\SI{1700}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) eruption, while \gls{j05} records a substantially
greater maximum temperature anomaly of \(\SI{-10.7}{\kelvin}\) compared to our \gls{c2w}
simulations.

Moving to fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}d, we revisit the relationship between \gls{rf}
and \gls{aod}, focusing on peak values rather than annual and seasonal averages. As
previously discussed, the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio displays weaker alignment than
previous studies \citep{jones2005, marshall2020, timmreck2010}, with \gls{c2w} peak
values not conforming to a linear trend. This comparison suggests potential significant
dependencies on the model and its input parameters, such as latitude. These complexities
add to the noise, which for the relatively small ensemble size of four used here may be
significant.

For fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}e, the \gls{c2w} data is anticipated to resemble the
patterns observed in fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}c due to the nearly linear association
identified between \gls{aod} and \iso{} in fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a. Although the
relationship between temperature and \gls{aod} appears to follow a similar trend,
stronger conclusions would necessitate additional data. Notably, the parallels between
the \gls{m20} data in figs.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}c and~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}e are
evident; however, it's essential to acknowledge that these were conducted with
prescribed sea surface temperatures, preventing the surface temperature from being fully
perturbed.

Finally, in fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}f, we compare the temperature and \gls{rf}
responses. Both the \gls{c2w} and \gls{ob16} datasets showcase a near-linear
relationship between temperature and \gls{rf}. The \gls{c2w} data indicates a steeper
gradient, potentially implying stronger temperature perturbations compared to
\gls{ob16}. However, limited data overlap and differences in model complexities prevent
robust conclusions, especially considering the potential biases in the values from the
analysis of the \gls{ob16} data, as outlined in Appendix B. This, along with
considerable noise, make the results from the analysis of the \gls{ob16} data less
reliable.

\subsection{Linearity between \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}}

Figures~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_ses_avg},~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios} and
\ref{fig:parameter_scan}d all indicate that as the \gls{aod} increases past \(\sim
1.0\), the scaling of \(\sim \SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) no longer map
to corresponding values of \gls{rf}. Looking at the intermediate volcanic eruption with
\(\SI{400}{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\) (\gls{c2wmp}) there seem to be a mostly linear
relationship between the \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} values, with a slope of approximately
\(\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\). As for the largest eruption, scaling
\gls{aod} by \(\sim \SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) yields reasonable
\gls{rf} values. From fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a we have an almost linear relation
between \iso{} and \gls{aod}. Previous results indicate that larger eruptions where more
\ce{SO2} is injected creates larger aerosols which are less effective at scattering
radiation, making the aerosol forcing less efficient
\citep{english2013,timmreck2010,timmreck2018}, an effect seen to influence the \gls{rf}
and not \gls{aod}.

\citet{timmreck2010} also note that for very large eruptions, such as Mt.\ Pinatubo and
\gls{ytt}, \ce{OH} radicals are not abundant enough, which limits the oxidation of
\ce{SO2}. The peak in \gls{aod} levels for the \gls{ytt} simulation appears six months
after the peak of Mt.\ Pinatubo in \citet{timmreck2010}, and at a much smaller value
compared to a \(100\times\) scaling (see Fig.\ 1c in \citet{timmreck2010}). This finding
is similar to what was discovered here and illustrated in
fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}a, where \gls{aod} peaks earlier for smaller
eruptions. \citet{timmreck2010} reported a peak \gls{rf} anomaly of
\(\SI{-18}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) (occurring \(7\)--\(8\) months after the eruption), while
\citet{jones2005} indicated a \(\SI{-60}{\watt\metre^{-2}}\) anomaly (one year after).
The \gls{rf} peak preceding the \gls{aod} peak aligns with our findings for \gls{cesm2},
approximately \(6\)--\(8\) months post-eruption (refer to
fig.~\ref{fig:compare-waveform-temp}b). Although the magnitude of the \gls{rf} peak is
much smaller in \citet{timmreck2010} compared to our findings, it corresponds well with
both the functional fit established by \citet{niemeier2015} and the lower bounds from
eruption simulations conducted by \citet{marshall2020}. Therefore, it is evident that
the \gls{aod} time series is influenced by the magnitude of \iso{}, impacting the timing
of the peak. Meanwhile, the \gls{rf} time series exhibit a similar shape but with
smaller relative magnitudes as the \iso{} increases.

While the \gls{j05} data is comparable to the \gls{c2ws} simulation case in both
\gls{aod} and \gls{rf}, the temperature response reported by \citet{jones2005} is much
stronger than what our strongest eruption produce. Since \citet{jones2005} used the
\gls{aod} forcing from Mt.\ Pinatubo multiplied by one hundred, the shape of the time
series is notably different to what a super-eruption would create. This might be enough
to cause a much stronger temperature perturbation. We also note that
\citet{timmreck2010} used a more realistic \gls{aod} forcing and obtained cooling that
was much smaller than \citet{jones2005}.

The biggest spread is found when converting from \iso{} to any of the three output
parameters when comparing across models. Conversion from \iso{} to \gls{aod} is
consistent within similar models, even when comparing simulations of volcanic eruptions
\citep{timmreck2010} and continuous injection of \ce{SO2} \citep{niemeier2015}, but has
a wide spread at large values of \iso{} across models
(figs.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}a,b,c). Compared to \gls{aod} as a function of \iso{},
both \gls{rf} (fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}d) and temperature
(fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}e) as a function of \gls{aod} result in a small spread in
the data across models, and necessarily the spread will also be small for temperature as
a function of \gls{rf} (fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}f). A roughly linear relationship
between \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} have been assumed is several previous studies, but (1)
for smaller values of \gls{aod} and \gls{rf}, and (2) where the estimated slope is
significantly steeper; around \(\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) at
\(\mathrm{AOD}<1\) rather than \(\sim\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) found
here at \(\mathrm{AOD}\gg1\). We therefore expect a linear relationship to be a precise
estimate of the \gls{rf} dependence on \gls{aod} for eruptions of the same magnitude or
less than Mt.\ Pinatubo. For larger eruptions, lack of \ce{OH} and aerosol growth
affecting both reflectance and their gravitational pull, significantly influence both
the \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} evolution.

From the \gls{c2w} cases in particular, there appear to be a time-after-eruption
dependency on the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio. \citet{marshall2020} discuss the same
feature, but find when looking at \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} that the efficiency increases
from year 1 to year 2, while here efficiency decreases with time, as shown in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}. \citet{marshall2020} explain that this is due
to the time it takes for the aerosols to spread which affects the global albedo and in
turn the \gls{rf}, with the \gls{aod} being less affected by the aerosols spreading.
However, when looking only at the tropical eruptions in \gls{m20} (between \(-10\) and
\(\SI{10}{\degree\mathrm{N}}\)), the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio become
indistinguishable to what found here from the \gls{c2wmp} simulations. Thus, while the
\iso{} is important when estimating the time average of the \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio,
latitude and more specifically how the aerosols spread appear to be more influential on
deciding the time-after-eruption evolution of the ratio. As the \gls{c2wsn} case do not
have the same strong increase in ratio as the tropical eruption simulations, the large
difference in eruption latitude is a likely cause.

\citet{marshall2019, marshall2020, marshall2021} used a code with seven log-normal modes
to simulate aerosol mass and number concentrations, along with a model run in an
atmosphere-only configuration with prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea ice
extent \citep{marshall2019}, as opposed to the \gls{cesm2} which is run as an \gls{esm}.
The configuration used by \citet{marshall2019} is from the model UM-UKCA, which is an
extended version of the HadGEM3 \citep{dhomse2014}, which in turn is from a different
family of models than both \gls{cesm2} and ECHAM5/MIP-ESM (used by
\citet{timmreck2010,niemeier2015}), but an ancestor of HadCM3 (used by
\citet{gregory2016}) \citep{kuma2023}. Based on fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}, model
family is suggested to play a big role in deciding the \gls{aod} and \gls{rf} magnitudes
estimated from \iso{}, while the different models generally are more consistent in
representing \gls{rf} from \gls{aod}. As \gls{m20} use a model from a different family
than both \gls{ob16} and the \gls{c2w} cases, and \gls{t10} and \gls{n15}, while being
able to cover the parameter space between the two families, it would be interesting if
the \gls{m20} data included higher values of \iso{} to see if it would still be bounded
below and above. This also raises the question of whether a saturation of \iso{} at a
certain level, as done in \citet{niemeier2015}, result in a lower bound \gls{rf}
efficiency estimate, similar to what a high-latitude eruption would produce.
Alternatively there could be differences in model aerosol chemistry that give the wide
span in \gls{rf} as a function of \iso{}.

Smaller eruptions and estimates from them give an \gls{rf} to \gls{aod} ratio that is
quite large (\(\sim \SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\)), while larger
eruptions (or yearly \iso{} in the atmosphere as used in \citet{niemeier2015}) result in
estimates that are smaller in magnitude (\(\sim
\SI{-10}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) to \(\sim
\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\), as shown in
fig.~\ref{fig:aod_vs_toa_avg_loop_ratios}). \citet{niemeier2017} show that the
efficiency decrease as the injection rate increase, which is related to that larger
volcanic eruptions results in larger aerosol particle sizes which in turn result in a
decreasing forcing efficiency per \iso{} \citep{english2013, timmreck2018}.

\subsection{Climate sensitivity estimate}

% NOTE: climate feedback/response parameter

The climate feedback parameter is estimated by \citet{jones2005} to be \(\alpha \simeq
\SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), which was more than twice (and half the
sensitivity, since \(\alpha =1/s\) where \(s\) is the climate sensitivity parameter) of
what \citet{gregory2016} obtained in their simulations using Pinatubo in the HadCM3
climate model.

Instead of estimating \(\alpha \), we focus our attention to the climate resistance
\(\rho \) and the \gls{tcrp} \(1/\rho\) (where \(\mathrm{TCS}=F_{2\times}\times
\mathrm{TCRP}\) is the transient climate sensitivity). Even though the forcing from
volcanic eruptions last only for about a year, which is too short for the timescales at
which \(F=\rho T\) is valid \citep{gregory2016}, we may get around this by using a
time-integral form introduced by \citet{merlis2014}
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t=\rho\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \rho=\frac{\int_0^{\tau}F \mathrm{d}t}{\int_{0}^{\tau}T \mathrm{d}t}.
  \label{eq:climate-resistance}
\end{equation}
%
If the upper bound of the integral, \(\tau \), is big enough such that the upper ocean
heat capacity is the same at \(t=0\) and \(t=\tau \), then this agrees with \(F=\rho T\)
\citep{gregory2016} (\citet{merlis2014} used \(\tau =\SI{15}{\mathrm{y}}\)). We also
note that the climate resistance and the climate feedback parameter are related to the
ocean heat uptake efficiency \(\kappa \) through \(\rho =\alpha +\kappa \).

We estimate the climate resistance following the integral-form computation laid out in
eq.~\ref{eq:climate-resistance} and using \(\tau =\SI{8}{\mathrm{yr}}\), as this is as
long as our simulations run. The three tropical simulation cases (four in each ensemble)
give estimated climate resistance \(\rho \) of \(\num{3.3(9)}\), \(\num{3.12(9)}\) and
\(\num{2.91(8)}\), and \gls{tcrp} (\(1/\rho\)) of \(\num{0.32(7)}\), \(\num{0.321(9)}\)
and \(\num{0.34(1)}\), shown in table~\ref{tab:trcp}. The climate resistance parameter
\(\rho\) is not the same as the climate feedback parameter \citet{jones2005} estimated
(\(\alpha\)), but as both \(\alpha \) and \(\kappa \) are positive, and our estimates of
\(\rho (=\alpha +\kappa) \) are all smaller than the \citet{jones2005} estimate of
\(\alpha \simeq \SI{4}{\watt\metre^{-2}\kelvin^{-1}}\), we conclude that the climate
feedback parameter related to the simulations performed here must be significantly
smaller than what \citet{jones2005} got. Since the temperature perturbation obtained by
\gls{j05} was also higher than any obtained here, the forcing used by \gls{j05} must be
stronger. The main contributor to the increased forcing strength is believed to be due
to the shape of the \gls{aod} time series used rather than the magnitude, as the
magnitude was comparable to what was used here in the \gls{c2ws} and \gls{c2wsn} cases.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we considered three large to super-volcano sized eruptions. We investigate
the \gls{rf} as a function of \gls{aod} and look at their ratio, and find that the
\gls{rf} dependence of \(\sim\SI{-20}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\) is consistent
with our results for eruptions of similar size in terms of \iso{} as Mt.\ Pinatubo.
Larger eruptions with one to two orders of magnitude more \iso{} is found to produce a
much more shallow gradient closer to \(\sim
\SI{-5}{\watt\metre^{-2}\mathrm{AOD}^{-1}}\). A more shallow gradient for larger
eruptions is also consistent with data from previous studies of super-volcanoes.

We find that there is generally hard to find a consistent conversion between \iso{} and
\gls{aod} that translates well between models, while from our simulations in the
\gls{cesm2} there is close to a linear relationship between \iso{} and \gls{aod}.

The time-after-eruption dependence of the ratio between \gls{rf} and \gls{aod} have been
reported before, but where the efficiency increased with time \citep{marshall2020}, that
is, \gls{rf} became relatively larger when compared with \gls{aod}. Our simulations
rather show a decrease in the aerosol forcing efficiency, where the \gls{aod} was
relatively larger than \gls{rf} later in the eruption phase. We also find that the same
trend is indeed found in the \gls{m20} dataset when including only tropical eruptions,
and as such conclude that latitude is significant in deciding the aerosol forcing
efficiency generally, and as a function of time-after-eruption specifically.

An interesting aspect concerning the decay phase in both the \gls{aod} and the \gls{rf}
time series is the influence of the decay on the temperature time series, perhaps
inducing a trend. That is, do the temperature time series decay similarly to either the
\gls{aod} or the \gls{rf}? Allowing the simulations to run for at least twenty years to
enable the tail to be well resolved is therefore another avenue that could be explored
further.

\appendixtitle{Simulation set up and output}

Simulations were created using a modified version of the file
\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl},
via a Python project developed on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking}. The project is also available from the
Python package manager PyPI\@. The program creates volcanoes with a given \ce{SO2}
amount that is injected over six
hours\footnote{\url{http://svn.code.sf.net/p/codescripts/code/trunk/ncl/emission/createVolcEruptV3.ncl}}
at a given latitude, longitude and altitude. All volcanic \ce{SO2} files are created by
setting the eruption details in a~.json file that is read to the
\texttt{volcano-cooking} CLI at a fixed version, making for a reproducible experiment
setup.

We are using the \texttt{BWma1850} component
setup\footnote{\url{https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/config/2.1.0/compsets.html}}
to run the \gls{cesm2}, and an accompanying \gls{fsst} simulation to obtain estimates of
the \gls{rf}. The \gls{fsst} simulation used is not from a standardised component setup
as of \gls{cesm2} (v2.1.3), but is instead specified in full.\footnote{\fssturl} They
differ in \texttt{CICE -> CICE\%PRES}, which is prescribed sea-ice,
\texttt{POP2\%ECO\%DEP -> DOCN\%DOM} which is from a dynamical ocean to a prescribed
data ocean and the wave component \texttt{WW3 -> SWAV} which is now a stub wave
component instead of the full \gls{ww3}.

\gls{rf} is calculated as the combined (\gls{sw} and \gls{lw}) all-sky \gls{toa} energy
imbalance, where the \gls{cesm2} provide the output variables \gls{fsnt} and \gls{flnt}.
Thus, \(\mathrm{RF_*}= \mathrm{FSNT} - \mathrm{FLNT}\), and taking the difference
between volcanic simulations and a control simulation gives the final estimate of
\gls{rf} (\(\mathrm{RF}=\mathrm{RF_{VOLC}}-\mathrm{RF_{CONTROL}}\))
\citep{marshall2020}. The output parameters that go into this estimate are from he
\gls{fsst} simulation, hence this outline specifically describe how to calculate
\gls{erf} as opposed to \gls{irf}, which instead is the difference between the \gls{erf}
and the sum of all rapid atmospheric adjustments \citep{marshall2020,smith2018}. The
\gls{aod} is obtained from the output variable \gls{aodm}, while global temperature is
saved by \gls{cesm2} to the variable \gls{trefht}. These four output variables are all
that are used throughout this paper. The important input data used in the model
simulations are \iso{} in units of teragrams (\(\si{\tera\gram(\ce{SO2})}\)), used to
simulate volcanic eruptions.

\appendix[B]

\appendixtitle{Otto-Bliesner data analysis}\label{ap:ob16}

Data from \citet{ottobliesner2016} are the original input data of \iso{} as used in
their model simulations, where corresponding \gls{rf} and temperature data are found as
the value of the time series at the time of an eruption (according to the \iso{} time
series). Therefore, \gls{rf} and temperature values may be somewhat smaller in
figs.~\ref{fig:parameter_scan}b,c,f than their true value. Specifically, an ensemble of
5 is used for both \gls{rf} and temperature, and a mean from the 5 is used as the de
facto \gls{rf} and temperature time series. A control simulation of a single time series
is used to remove seasonal dependence from the temperature, where the control simulation
is averaged into a climatology mean. Further, a drift in the temperature is removed by
subtracting a linear regression fit. \gls{rf} have seasonality removed in the Fourier
domain. The forcing (\ce{SO2}) can be downloaded with direct link
\url{https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/volc/IVI2LoadingLatHeight501-2000_L18_c20100518.nc},
or found at \url{https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/paleo/simulations/ccsm4-lm}
and \url{https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/volc/}.

The time of an eruption is decided based on a best attempt at aligning the \ce{SO2} time
series with both the \gls{rf} time series and the temperature time series individually.
The \gls{rf} and temperature values used in the \gls{ob16} data points are the exact
values at day 340 (\gls{rf}) and 400 (temperature) after the eruption according to the
\iso{} time series. Thus, missing the peak means the estimates will be biased towards
lower values, while other eruptions occurring close in time will contribute a bias to
higher values.
